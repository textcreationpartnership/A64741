            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>SEeing the publick hath taken in good part both my boldneſs in offering to write the Hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth after <note place="margin">The Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are placed here according to the order of time they wrote in.</note> 
               <hi>La Popilimore, Maſſon, Thuanus, Aubigne, Matthieu, Tortora, Davila, Dupleix,</hi> and <hi>Mezeray,</hi> as alſo the Preface in the new manner that I prefixed to the beginning thereof, perhaps it will not take it ill that I have made an eſſay upon a ſubject that hath not as yet been handled: That I give it now the <hi>Pattern for the Education of Princes,</hi> and that I add ſome illuſtrations upon the principal Manuſcripts from which it hath been taken. All that I have to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further is to intimate to the Reader, that he is not here to expect Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Elogies, but bare remarks, which I make not ſo much as curious but as being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the underſtanding of what comes after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Emperour Maximilian the firſt</hi> hath been the moſt ſingular Prince that wore
<pb facs="tcp:53255:3"/> a Crown in theſe laſt ages. He was dumb until the age of ten years; and as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Phyſicians could not diſcover the cauſe of his diſtemper, ſo neither could they find a remedy for it; at the end of that time preciſely his ſpeech came to him; and by the volubility of his tongue, nature made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for her ſlowneſs in allowing him the uſe of it. He was the Son of the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, and <hi>Leonora</hi> Infanta of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and he had almoſt an equal ſhare of the predominant inclinations of his Father and Mother. <hi>Frederick</hi> loved mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beyond what can be imagined, and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> loved as well to ſpend it. <hi>Maximilian</hi> was ſubject to both theſe failings; and as no man ever more ſolicitouſly ſought out ways to fill his coffers when they were empty, ſo never any man was more impatient to empty them when they were full. He only received that he might give away by handfuls and without diſtinction; and reſembled thoſe pipes that never retain the water that comes into them, as if they only received it to ſpill it as faſt. He had not one hundred Crowns when he went to marry the Heireſs of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;</hi> and he was ſo happy as to have no other rival but the abominable <hi>Adolph</hi> of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> who was become the horrour of mankind through the inhumanity he had practiſed towards his own Father. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53255:3"/> was ſoon a Widower, and fortune offered him the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne</hi> for a ſecond Wife: but his Father refuſed him money to defray the charges of his journey, and no man would lend him a farthing, had it not been for that <hi>Bretagne</hi> would have eſcaped from the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, and been annexed to the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> His proſperities were blended with ſome misfortunes. <hi>Maximilian</hi> continued long the priſoner of the <hi>Flemings:</hi> after they had ſet him at liberty they refuſed him the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of the Archdukes, <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, and <hi>Charles</hi> his Grandſon; and forced him thereupon to write Letters, which are very far from the ſtile of his life, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrote afterwards. He ſtrips himſelf of Majeſty to demand from the Governours of the Archduke gratuities in ready money; and hath ſo forgotten his quality, that he would be vexed that one ſhould think on't. It's all one to him whether theſe Gratuities were made as a due or a preſent; and that he might obtain them the ſooner he conſents to things misbecoming his dignity.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more generous than the Letters of <hi>Louis the Twelfth</hi> to <hi>Chievres,</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> was informed that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had made him Governour to the Archduke; and the favour was ſo great that it could not ſufficiently be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
<pb facs="tcp:53255:4"/> Nevertheleſs <hi>Louis</hi> ſeems to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that <hi>Chievres</hi> may ſuſpect that he hath not obliged him for nothing. His Majeſty writing to him thinks no more of that favour which had been the moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all his kindneſſes; and he is for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Chievres</hi> forget it as well as he: He never deſires any thing of him but with ſuch cautions as leave him fully to his liberty; nor does he neither apply himſelf directly to him upon the differences ariſen betwixt the Provinces of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> and the <hi>Walloons:</hi> He makes him believe that he reſerves him for better occaſions, and chuſes rather to write to the Council of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> though he is not ignorant that <hi>Chievres</hi> is the head of it, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can paſs therein but what is approved by him: He pretends to convince the moſt incredulous that he demands nothing of him but what the <hi>Flemings</hi> ſhall think rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; and by that means he is ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he deſires, and <hi>Chievres</hi> not to be ſuſpected to have obliged him in granting it. <hi>Louis</hi> follows not altogether the ſame Conduct in reſpect of the Archduke, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remembers that he is his feudatary. Not but that in ſome rencounters he treats him as his equal, becauſe the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> belonged to him already, and that he was preſumptive Heir of that of <hi>Arragon:</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:53255:4"/> on other occaſions his Majeſty labours indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to put him in mind that he is not conſiderable but becauſe of the Territories which he holds of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and that he may forfeit them in caſe of fellony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Catholick King Ferdinand of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> at firſt managed <hi>Chievres</hi> by all the ways that policy hath invented, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence permits, ſo long as he had any hopes of rendering him favourable unto him: But ſo ſoon as the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> had declared for the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> there was no more place for diſſimulation, or it appeared ſo uſeleſs that it was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> propoſed to himſelf to remove <hi>Chievres</hi> from his Grandſon; and ſome relations are ſo malicious as to add, that it was none of his fault if revenge went not farther. <hi>Chievres</hi> had timely enough notice to remedy it; but he always confined his reſentment within ſo narrow limits, that his Majeſty had ground to imagin that he had ſafely offended him. Nor did he think neither that he ought to take greater liberty after that Doctor <hi>Adrian</hi> was raiſed up againſt him; and he diſcontinued not to reſpect the Maternal Grandfather of the Archduke, though he knew him to be the greateſt and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy that he had.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53255:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry the Eighth King of England,</hi> neglected the Politicks of his Predeceſſors, and took a way of his own that ſucceeded not with him. The five laſt Kings from whom he held the Crown, ſuppoſed that it was enough for them to keep in alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to have the better on't as often as they attacked <hi>France;</hi> and they found it to anſwer their ends ſo well, that ſince the Battel of <hi>Azincour,</hi> till the fight of <hi>Hareas,</hi> their forces had always worſted the <hi>French</hi> that durſt reſiſt them. <hi>Henry</hi> offered at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, and would needs give the Law to the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> whilſt they were in minority. <hi>Chievres</hi> pleaſed him not for the very reaſon that he had been made Governour to the Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> by <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth. He formed then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues to have him depoſed, and a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Lord in whom he confided put in his place; and ſeeing he foreſaw that he could not be powerful enough to ſucceed in it by his ſingle authority, he joyned with the Catholick King. The inſtances of both the one and other were ſo urgent, that it is ſtrange how a Prince of nine years of age could be able to reſiſt them. <hi>Chievres</hi> for all that ſtood his ground, and the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Henry</hi> abated not for having been baulked in ſo famous a quarrel. He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb facs="tcp:53255:5"/> not the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> after his own way its true, but he took the quality of Arbiter betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and he cauſed himſelf to be painted hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his right hand a Ballance, in the two Scales whereof were the two Monarchies we have mentioned in ſo juſt a counterpoiſe; that it depended abſolutely on him to caſt the Scale into which he let fall the weight that he held in his left-hand. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption was the more ridiculous, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were not then what they had been during the fourteenth and fifteenth ages. <hi>France</hi> was enlarged by the Provinces of <hi>Province, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Bretagne;</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> wholly united into one, except <hi>Portugal.</hi> And indeed <hi>Henry</hi> found by experience that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were no more in a condition of giving Laws to the <hi>French;</hi> and though when leagued with the Emperour, the Catholick King, the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> and the Pope, for reviving his ancient pretenſions to <hi>Picardie,</hi> he took a great many Towns; yet he had ſo ſmall hopes to keep them, that having plundered he either abandoned or burnt them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in his Negotiations he ſtill retains ſome aſcendant over the Archduke; and if he heat him not as his inferiour, he takes the liberty to ſet him Leſſons. He writes to
<pb facs="tcp:53255:6"/> 
               <hi>Chievres</hi> with the greateſt indifference ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; and by the manner how he ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites him it is eaſie to judg, that great men obſerve but very few meaſures with thoſe whom they have a mind to undo.</p>
            <p>They who maintain that <hi>Charles of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> changed his ſtile after the Battel of <hi>Pavia;</hi> and that whereas till then his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been moſt civil, they afterwards ſcandalized all <hi>Europe</hi> by their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary haughtineſs, have not read that which begins with theſe words, <hi>My Viceroy of Naples.</hi> It is in <hi>French</hi> indeed, but never any King of <hi>Spain</hi> wrote ſo imperiouſly. There are others alſo that come very near, if they do not match it; and perhaps it may be true if one ſuppoſe here, that <hi>Charles</hi> practiſed wonderfully well what he had learnt from his Governour, that he ought to treat with Nations with whom he had to do according to their Genius, and the need he ſtood in of them. Thus we find in the Letters which he writes to the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> a condeſcenſion that ſeems to degenerate into a lowneſs; but as to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> he is ſo jealous of his Grandeur, that he is afraid to ruffle it by the leaſt word of compleaſance that might eſcape him. If he pray the <hi>Italians,</hi> it is but rarely and ſtill backt with ſome order.
<pb facs="tcp:53255:6"/> To the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he never ſtoops ſo low; and though he think them not always obliged to do what he deſires, yet he only propoſes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his will and pleaſure; as if he cared not ſo much to be refuſed, as unſeaſonably to hazard his gravity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julian de la Ronera Pope,</hi> by the name of <hi>Julius the Second,</hi> treats <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Chievres,</hi> with almoſt as much loſtineſs as if the Archduke were the Feudatary, and his Governour a ſubject of the Holy See. As he had changed the friendſhip which he had for <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth into an extreme averſion, though his Majeſty had given him neither cauſe nor pretext for it, ſo he gives himſelf no trouble to excuſe his inconſtancy. He will have all the Sovereigns of <hi>Europe</hi> to change in imitation of him; and cannot endure that the Archduke and <hi>Chievres</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him with all imaginable reſpect that his Holineſs had heretofore not only approved that the <hi>Flemings</hi> ſhould live in a good correſpondence with the <hi>French,</hi> but that beſides he had laboured for almoſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years to reconcile thoſe two Nations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions when they were ready to fall into variance. <hi>Julius</hi> anſwers that what he did as Cardinal of <hi>St. Peter ad vincula</hi> ought not to be brought as an inſtance of what he ought to do as <hi>Pope;</hi> and there
<pb facs="tcp:53255:7"/> is a neceſſity of replying to him that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are as uncapable of enjoying a full liberty, as of ſubmitting to an entire ſlavery: That, to ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they have no neighbours to be afraid of but the <hi>French;</hi> and that provided they keep peace with them, they are certain of greateſt tranquillity: That they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an extreme deference for the Holy See, but that that deference carries them not ſo far as to put them into bad intelligence with the Moſt Chriſtian King: That if they be forced to it they will infallibly revolt; and that <hi>Julius</hi> who would puſh them upon that extreme, cannot be able to aſſiſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke neither with Forces nor Money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. <hi>Julius</hi> having nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, falls into paſſion, and threatens the Archduke and his Governour, but he dies before he found an occaſion to do them hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Angelo de Medicis,</hi> ſo famous by the name of <hi>Leo the Tenth,</hi> takes a courſe contrary to <hi>Julius</hi> in regard of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke. He calls him the moſt affectionate Son to the Holy See: He conſiders him with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to what one day he foreſees he will be, and reſpects him as much as he does any of the chief Monarchs of <hi>Europe.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to himſelf at firſt to turn the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53255:7"/> out of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and has not ſo good an opinion of himſelf as to hope to bring it about by his own Forces. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is ſuſpected by him, becauſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and the Catholick King for his infidelity. He knows that <hi>Chievres</hi> makes it his chief care to arm the Archduke againſt thoſe two vices, and he would have the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> make advantage thereof. But the care of his Holineſs is not altogether diſintereſted. He is very willing that the Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> aſſiſt the <hi>Italians</hi> in the recovery of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> but he deſires not that he ſhould have any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for it but the glory of having done ſuch an action: He diſſembles not but that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian Sforza</hi> ought to be freely reſtored to the State which his Father and Grandfather have poſſeſſed; and will by no means have it repreſented to him that it would be to no purpoſe to act for him, ſeeing he could not maintain himſelf in it, and that the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would be forced to be continually in Arms for no other end but to oppoſe the Kings of <hi>France</hi> as often as they might have a mind to recover what they ſhould loſe.</p>
            <p>Of ſo many who ſince two hundred years have written the Hiſtory of the <hi>Cardinal George of Amboiſe,</hi> it ſeems there is
<pb facs="tcp:53255:8"/> none that hath given him his true Character. Yet he had one ſo ſingular that it will be hard to find the like in the other Miniſters of State of theſe laſt ages. It conſiſted in this that he laid his own Grandeur for the foundation of his Maſters greatneſs. The deſign which he formed was as ample and handſom, as <hi>Sully</hi> ſo pompouſly deſcribes it to be at the end of his <hi>Memoirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it was not altogether neceſſary in the judgment of the Cardinal of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> that <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſhould be united under one ſole Monarch, that ſo it might more eaſily reſiſt the Infidels, he pretended at leaſt that it ought to have one King ſo powerful as that he might alone be able to make head againſt the Armies of the <hi>Turks</hi> when they ſhould advance to ravage the Countries which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined neareſt upon the Empire, until the other Chriſtian Princes might have time to arm and march to his relief. It behoved for that that <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth having recovered the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould ſtill render himſelf the moſt powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that he ſhould have a Fleet there in a readineſs to cruiſe upon the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and his Majeſty could not do that without he had the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at his devotion. There were at that time ſo few <hi>French</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in the Sacred Colledg, that it was
<pb facs="tcp:53255:8"/> hardly to be expected that the reſolutions of it would be advantageous to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth. To augment the number of them it was neceſſary to raiſe a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to the Holy See; and though no body accuſes the Cardinal of <hi>amboiſe</hi> of having too good an opinion of himſelf, yet he imagined himſelf to be the fitteſt of his Nation for bearing the chief of all Eccleſiaſtical Dignities. He thought that the conſideration, power and merit of the King his Maſter would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obtain it for him; and if he took other meaſures, it was only to keep <hi>decorum.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>St. Peter ad vincula</hi> owed his life and liberty unto him: during twelve years time he had teſtified his gratitude for it which the ſharpeſt ſighted would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſincere. He offered the Cardinal of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> to procure for him the voices which he wanted, and he was taken at his word. Nevertheleſs inſtead of keeping his promiſe, he hindered his Benefactor from being elected in the Conclave of <hi>Pius</hi> the Third, and in the following Conclave got himſelf choſen in excluſion of him. The Cardinal of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was no leſs unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the third meaſures he took for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Papacy. The Catholick King had the art to make him ſenſible on the one hand that without him he could never obtain
<pb facs="tcp:53255:9"/> what he deſired, and on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman who renounced the friendſhip of <hi>Francis de Ciſneros Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Ximenes</hi> when he ſaw him Miniſter of State was not ſo far out as men have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. He knew him thoroughly, and was not miſtaken in his opinion that that new dignity would cauſe a ſtrange alteration in him. Certainly ſo ſtrange a Metamorphoſis as that was is not to be found in the Hiſtory of latter ages; and <hi>Ximenes</hi> whoſe thoughts till then were wholly confined to the Convent of <hi>Cordeliers</hi> of <hi>Talavera</hi> where he had made profeſſion, were now filled only with notions that tended to the aggrandizing of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. He remembred no more neither his Mediocrity nor his Birth, nor yet the frequent humiliations which he had practiſed in his Cloyſter. He minded nothing at leaſt outwardly but Politick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and he laboured more to reduce the Grandees of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to their duty, than to ſubdue his own paſſions. Not that he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected regular auſterities, which he made ſufficiently appear on this occaſion. He was preſent at the Sermon of a Frier of his
<pb facs="tcp:53255:10"/> Order who made a long invective againſt him; and having ſent for him as he came out of the Pulpit, he perceived that he wore a ſhirt contrary to his rule, and only rebuked him for it by ſhewing him the hair-cloth which himſelf had on: but that was all that he retained of his ancient profeſſion, and in all things elſe nothing appeared in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of what he had been before. He trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as his equals the moſt conſiderable of the high nobility, not excepting the Dukes of <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Infantado.</hi> However he promiſed his alliance to the Duke of <hi>Infantado</hi> by giving his Neece in Marriage to the Dukes Nephew, but he ſoon repented it; and made amends for his fault in ſuch a manner as made his parts more to be admired, than his ambition was blamed. He ſuppoſed that the power of the Catholick Kings ought to be ſounded on the depreſſion of the Nobles, and he laboured in that all his life-time without omitting any occaſion. He obliged them in ſmall matters, and was againſt them in great: But he had always care to make it appear he was in the right; and by that means all the Burghers and Peaſants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly for him in all occaſions when the Nobility conſpired either to depoſe or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate him. In every thing he jumps with <hi>Chievres</hi> wherein the greatneſs of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53255:10"/> Monarchy is concerned; but he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways againſt him when the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> have any competition with the Monarchy of <hi>Spain. Chievres</hi> as being a <hi>Fleming</hi> will have his Country to be the baſis of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which the Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> aſpires; and that the others which he is to inherit by the diſtraction of his Mother, and the death of his Grandfathers, ſhould only be the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory. <hi>Ximenes</hi> on the contrary pretends that <hi>Spain</hi> muſt always be the centre of the Archdukes Grandeur, and the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> be reduced into bare Provinces. <hi>Chievres</hi> repreſents to him in vain that they belong not to the Archduke by right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and that if <hi>Philip</hi> his Father had not poſſeſſed them, they would not have given him in Marriage the heireſs of <hi>Spain. Ximenes</hi> makes no ſatisfactory reply: but he perſiſts in his project; and in that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not that he thereby provokes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a young Prince, who well quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become his Maſter.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſie to determine whether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did good or hurt to Doctor <hi>Adrian Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> in taking him out of the Colledg of <hi>Louvain</hi> whereof he was principal, to raiſe him to all the Dignities of the Church, not excepting the Papacy. He had a Genius for the functions that render men famous in
<pb facs="tcp:53255:11"/> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities: but he went no farther: and amongſt the many employments that he had afterward, there was not one that ſuited with him. He had acquired reputation in the Schools, and in the Pulpit: His Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon the Maſter of Sentences was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and certainly if that Book was not the moſt ſubtil of the three hundred of the ſame nature which then were to be found in Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it was at leaſt the cleareſt and moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical. His Harangues for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the priviledges of Scholars had had better ſucceſs than he had promiſed himſelf; and not only the Archduke <hi>Philip</hi> confirmed them, but beſides honoured the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Louvain</hi> by being a member of it. It was thereupon imagined that it would be a diſgrace to the <hi>Flemings</hi> to ſuffer <hi>Adrian</hi> to continue longer in <hi>Louvain;</hi> and it was not ſo much to do him juſtice as to ſatisfie the publick deſire, that <hi>Chievres</hi> took him to be Preceptor to the Archduke <hi>Charles.</hi> He did not diſcharge his commiſſion ill ſo long as his buſineſs was to inſtruct his Scholar: But when he was ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> to negotiate with the Catholick King, he neither anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expectation of <hi>Chievres,</hi> nor of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who took him for the ableſt man of his Nation in Cabinet Councils. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at firſt that his Majeſty was an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
<pb facs="tcp:53255:11"/> enemy to <hi>Chievres;</hi> and from that he concluded that it would do irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prejudice to the intereſts of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, obſtinately to defend his Governour how innocent ſoever he was; for that reaſon alone he declared againſt <hi>Chievres:</hi> and if he was not powerful enough to ſupplant him, it was not his fault if he was not ſent home to his houſe, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intruſted with the ſupreme direction of the Council of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> He ſhew'd his weakneſs aſmuch after the death of the Catholick King, when he had the occaſion of making uſe of the Commiſſion which he brought from <hi>Flanders</hi> for being Regent of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> in caſe of that death. He ſuffered himſelf unſeaſonably to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who gained him by promiſing him the ſecond place in the Councils of <hi>Spain.</hi> He had, indeed, that place, but he wanted the Authority that ought to have gone along with it. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſometimes that the Cardinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with him only about matters of ſmall importance, and that he diſpatched the reſt without him: But that was all he did, and thought not that he ought to fall out with him about the matter. For that he had the Biſhoprick of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> and it was left to men to judg whether or not that was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:53255:12"/> proportionable to the power that he was deprived of. Death quickly rid him of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> as it protected <hi>Ximenes</hi> from the Catholick King; and he was afterward ſo happy, that he ingenuouſly confeſſed he could not comprehend his own happineſs. <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth made him a Cardinal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only of gratifying <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and the Conclave having ſpent ſeveral Months without coming to agreement about the perſon who ſhould ſucceed to <hi>Leo,</hi> in ſpight choſe him Pope; whence it came to paſs that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> loaded the Cardinals with reproaches as they came out, and threw ſtones at them. Till then the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of common Father had been ſo reſpected, that the Popes who had lived leaſt exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily laid it not altogether aſide, and made a fair ſhew at leaſt. <hi>Adrian</hi> neglected it at firſt; and when he went from <hi>Spain</hi> to go take poſſeſſion of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Chair, he carried with him into <hi>Lumbardy</hi> the ſix thouſand Soldiers who two years after took <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt before <hi>Pavia.</hi> Inſtead of keeping the Balance even, He took a ſide that he might rather caſt it; and if his Pontificate which laſted but two and twenty Months had been of longer duration, it would have raiſed a ſchiſm in the Church more dangerous than that of <hi>Urban</hi> the Sixth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53255:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>John Manuel</hi> was in reality the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of his age, moſt croſt by fortune, but by his ability and patience he forced her at length to be favourable. His extraction was low; but his way of writing wonderfully well, and yet very faſt, was the reaſon that when he was very young he was choſen under-Secretary of the Council of State of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He was not full eighteen years old when he grew weary of his Employment, though at firſt he thought himſelf moſt happy in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. He conſidered that the three chief Miniſters of <hi>Spain, Zapata, Carvaial,</hi> and <hi>Vargas</hi> were not much promoted; and that the richeſt of them had not a thouſand Crowns a year, though they had long ſerved the Catholick Kings <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle</hi> with all imaginable zeal, and that they had facilitated to them the conqueſt of the Kingdoms of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> That was not a reward proportionable to the greatneſs of their ſervices; and the truth is it cannot be denied but that the Catholick Kings were too great Husbands in that particular, if it be not pretended for their excuſe that the Revenues of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> were not ſufficient to gratifie the tenth part of their moſt faithful ſervants. <hi>Manuel</hi> who ſaw nothing but Crowns above his ambition, was ſatisfied to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Secretary
<pb facs="tcp:53255:13"/> of State during the life of Queen <hi>Iſabelle</hi> his Soveraign; but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his deſires higher when the Archduke <hi>Philip of Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Jane of Arragon</hi> his Wife went to <hi>Spain</hi> to get themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared apparent heirs of <hi>Caſtile. Manuel</hi> was perſwaded that that young Prince loved an eaſie life too well to trouble himſelf with the weight of affairs; and that if he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated himſelf into his favour before all other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he might govern him at his pleaſure; and obtain from him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould deſire. He was the firſt <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> that made his court to him; and won ſo much upon him, that none afterward could equal him in favour. The Archduke upon his return into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> took him not along with him; and had no cauſe to repent of it, ſeeing he ſerved him incomparably better in <hi>Caſtile</hi> than he could have done in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He was his ſpie during the ſickneſs of <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or at leaſt thought ſo, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament attributed to that Queen was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. He gave the Archduke private notice of it: ſupplied him with means to prove the forgery; encouraged him to make haſte back again into <hi>Spain;</hi> and promiſed to gain him a great party among the Grandees. What he wrote was not very probable; and
<pb facs="tcp:53255:13"/> it was rationally to be preſumed that the Catholick King would take the ſtart of his Son-in-law, and make ſure of the Nobility of <hi>Caſtile</hi> before the Archduke could be in a condition to ſollicite them to own him. Nevertheleſs there was greater deference had to <hi>Manuel</hi> than he deſerved. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke at his bare ſollicitation ſet forth on his journey; and extraordinary good luck co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the fault which he committed ſo very well, that it was ſcarcely perceived. He found that <hi>Manuel</hi> had acquired him the friendſhip of all the Grandees except the Dukes of <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> who more for ſhame than affection would not abandon the Catholick King. The party was too unequal, and maugre the oppoſition of thoſe two Dukes the Archduke was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red King. The efforts of the Catholick King for maintaining the pretended Teſtament were too weak; and he himſelf admired the inconſtancy of human affairs, when he ſaw his whole Court reduced to fifty perſons. It ſeemed at that time that <hi>Manuel</hi>'s head turned round, ſo pleaſed he was to inſult over a Prince who had been ſo long his Maſter. He thought it not enough to draw up the Articles which his Majeſty was forced to ſign; but it's ſaid, he alſo joyfully beheld him when mounted on a Mule without other
<pb facs="tcp:53255:14"/> Equipage he went to wait on his Son-in-law. The reign of the Archduke was ſo ſhort that nothing fell during it which <hi>Manuel</hi> thought worth the accepting but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Burgos.</hi> He obtained it, and it was at the feaſt which he made for his Maſter to thank him therefore, that that Prince, as they ſay, had the poyſon given him of which he died. There were ſome contemplative heads that thought it was given rather to put a ſtop to the proſperity of <hi>Manuel,</hi> than to make away the new King <hi>Philip.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the revolution was compleat, and <hi>Manuel</hi> all of a ſudden fell from the height of favour into the greateſt abjection. He ſuppoſed that the Catholick King would be revenged on him, upon the ſame ground that he would have continued to perſecute the Catholick King, if the life of <hi>Philip</hi> had been longer, and he Embarked for <hi>Flanders</hi> before he was apprehended. The Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> received him very well, and it was none of his fault but that the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Catholick King of the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> But the Emperour could not ſet out a Fleet to tranſport him into <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Catholick King having ſetled his Authority, wrote to the Archduke his Grandſon, and to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that he would
<pb facs="tcp:53255:14"/> diſinherit the former, and ruin the latter, if they did not puniſh <hi>Manuel.</hi> That was a terrible threatning; and he that made it was not of a humour to be appeaſed, nor patiently to take a denial. But on the other hand <hi>Manuel</hi> had obliged <hi>Philip,</hi> who having been Father to the Archduke, and Benefactor to <hi>Chievres,</hi> required that there ſhould be more conſideration had for a Miniſter whom he had cheriſhed, than for the Catholick King that hated him. The Expedient which <hi>Chievres</hi> found out to avoid thoſe two Rocks, was to put <hi>Manuel</hi> into priſon during the life of the Catholick King, with this qualification that he ſhould have all the ſatisfaction that he could deſire except his liberty. He propoſed to himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beſides, to ſecure the perſon of <hi>Manuel,</hi> who would have run the risk of being ſtab'd even though he had been environed with Guards: But Politicians are nicer than other men in the offences which they pretend to have received. <hi>Manuel</hi> who reaſoned ſo quaintly about matters of State, never thought of the motives which induced <hi>Chievres</hi> to do him a little hurt to preſerve him from a greater miſchief. He concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as great an averſion to him as he had entertained kindneſs for him before; and was not at all moved at the pains which
<pb facs="tcp:53255:15"/> 
               <hi>Chievres</hi> took to come in perſon and ſet him at liberty, ſo ſoon as the Courier who brought the news of the death of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King was arrived at <hi>Bruxelles. Chievres</hi> had not afterward a greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than <hi>Manuel,</hi> and the good offices he did him exaſperated rather than ſoſtened him. The Archduke who could not be without either of them, kept <hi>Chievres</hi> at Court; and ſent <hi>Manuel</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in two moſt difficult Intrigues. The buſineſs was not only to perſwade the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> to take from the Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> which he had recovered, and to ſend the <hi>French</hi> beyond the <hi>Alpes;</hi> but alſo to make them conſent that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> who already poſſeſſed the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſhould alſo conquer that Dutchy; that ſo they might enjoy two Thirds of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that keeping it incloſed within the two extremities, they might wait for an occaſion of ſubjecting the reſt. There was no appearance that the Conſiſtory and the Pregady would endure that ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a propoſal ſhall be made unto them, but the induſtry of <hi>Manuel</hi> ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeeming impoſſibility of ſucceſs.

That to take things aright, a Miniſter and Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite were no more in relation to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, than what a Steward is in reſpect of great men, and an intimate Friend to any private perſon; and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that great men and private perſons have the liberty of chuſing their Stewards and Friends, a young Prince ought not to be confined in the choice of a Miniſter

So that the earneſt deſire of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting <hi>Philip of Croy</hi> was the thing that made him diſagreeable; and <hi>Charles the Terrible,</hi> who in all appearance would have caſt his eyes upon him, had he not been ſpoke to about it, would by no means do it, becauſe be had been recommended unto him. <note place="margin">In the cauſes of the diſgrace of the Croyes.</note> He declared himſelf ſo briskly as to that, that his Father thought it not convenient to preſs him any farther; But the good Prince who had been only over ſollicitous becauſe of the extraordinary affection he had for the <hi>Croyes,</hi> perceived that in reſpect of them he had made one of thoſe politick ſteps which are irreparably hurtful when they do not ſucceed.

By the right of <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus haeres</hi> or <hi>Eſcheatage</hi> the whole Eſtate belonged to <hi>Philip the good,</hi> and he made a Preſent of it to the <hi>Croys.</hi> The libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, indeed, was great, but not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; ſeeing that Prince had ſometimes ſhewed the like, nay, and greater, to thoſe who had not ſerved him ſo faithfully as the <hi>Croys</hi> had done; however it paſſed for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, and a piece of Injuſtice in the notion of <hi>Charles the Terrible.</hi> He was already five and twenty years of age; married, <note place="margin">Maria Heireſs of Burgundy.</note> and the Father of one only Daughter, which was all the Children he had: In the mean time his Father, who had no more Children neither but him, had not as yet given him any thing in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Low Countries which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him in Succeſſion: He obliged him to live in the ſame Palace with himſelf, to eat at Table with him, follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions that he did, and to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſmall Penſion for defraying his other Expences. <hi>Charles,</hi> who was to be one of the richeſt Princes in Chriſtendom, would not be more pinched nor ſtinted, and omitted no opportunity of enlarging
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53255:25"/> his Fortune. Some Months before the death of the Lady of <hi>Bethune</hi> he had been informed that the fear of being poyſoned by thoſe to whom ſhe might leave her vaſt Eſtate would infallibly hinder her from making a Will, and therefore he begged the gift of it before-hand of his Father, who freely granted it him: But the good Prince had ſo wholly forgot it, that he did not ſo much as remember even when his Son put him in mind of it. He made anſwer to him in a poſitive manner, that he had never promiſed in all his life time one and the ſame thing to two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons; and that ſeeing he had granted the <hi>Croys</hi> the Eſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Bethune,</hi> it muſt needs be, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſed it to the Prince of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He continued ſo firm in that particular, that the <hi>Croys</hi> had the gift: But no ſooner did thoſe that envied them perceive how much the Prince of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented thereat, but that they inflamed his reſentment by a rumour they raiſed in his Fathers Court, that the Duke would not ſtop there; and that he had only enriched the <hi>Croys</hi> with the Succeſſion of <hi>Bethune,</hi> that it might appear leſs ſtrange in the World when he ſhould deveſt himſelf, and fruſtrate his only Son of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Province of the Low Countries, by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53255:25"/> inveſting them in the Province of <hi>Namur</hi> in the ſame manner as he poſſeſſed it, to wit, in abſolute ſovereignty. Thus affairs went already, but bad enough at the Court of <hi>Burgundy</hi> for the <hi>Croys,</hi> when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accident which at firſt was thought would retrieve all, made every thing go worſe and worſe with them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh, ſtood in ſo bad terms with <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh his Father, that his Majeſty drove him out of the Province of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> where he could not endure that whilſt he was alive another ſhould rule as a Sovereign Prince, ſeeing there was no ſecurity for him in any other place in <hi>Europe</hi> but in the Low Countries, no other State being in the humour to refuſe the delivering him up to his Father in caſe he ſhould demand him; and that beſides, <hi>Philip the Good</hi> had ſufficiently made it known, to confirm the opinion that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> had of him, that if he deſired him to receive him at his Court he would not conſent to it, for fear of quarrelling with <hi>France;</hi> but that if he entered the Low Countries without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding permiſſion, <hi>Philip,</hi> who gloried in Hoſpitality, and had granted it to all ſorts of People, not excepting even the perſons of Kings, would not be ſo hard as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53255:26"/> to ſend him back again; The <hi>Dauphin</hi> came as far as <hi>Brabant</hi> before it was known at the Court of <hi>Burgundy</hi> that he was upon his Journey.</p>
            <p>His conjecture proved true; and <hi>Philip</hi> though he was extremely troubled at his having ſuch a Gueſt, yet durſt not deſire him to depart out of the Low Countries: His only care was how he might civilly ſend him back again, and for that end choſe the expedient of reconciling him to his Father. He therein employed the Offices of his Agents; and becauſe ſo thorny a negotiation was not the buſineſs of one day, he commanded the <hi>Croys</hi> to divert the <hi>Dauphin</hi> in the mean time, and to link themſelves in a ſtrict friendſhip with him.</p>
            <p>Obedience is never more readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, than when the Orders of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns ſuit with the preſent intereſts of thoſe who receive them. The <hi>Croys</hi> were perſwaded that there was no neceſſity of affecting any more a ſcrupulous complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for the Prince of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> they had Eſtates in <hi>France:</hi> they foreſaw that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> would ſhortly be King, and they ſtood abſolutely in need of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to ſecure them from the formidable Enemy whom they could not avoid but to have one day upon their backs. In
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53255:26"/> that proſpect they omitted nothing that might win the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> and ſucceeded therein the more eaſily, that that Prince, the moſt aſſiduous of his Age, to make ſure of thoſe from whom he thought he might procure ſervices, on his part met them more than half way. He had juſt before in ſome Conferences that he had had with the Prince of <hi>Burgundy</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the ſtrange Antipathy that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their two tempers. He made no doubt but that it would one day be the cauſe of a War betwixt them that might laſt as long as they lived: he thought it convenient to prepare for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: He foreſaw how uſeful the <hi>Croys</hi> would then be to him; And that was enough to make him endeavour to gain them in a point which failed not to produce its natural effect, which the <hi>Croys</hi> had not ſufficiently apprehended, ſince it encreaſed the hatred of the Prince of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, adding to the diſcontent, diſdain, anger and reſentment which he already entertained, Jealouſie in that he perceived they ſought to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by protection againſt him. He was ſo ſenſibly touched with this, that he obſerved no more meaſures with thoſe whom he regarded now far leſs than before, ſince his Father preſſed him no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53255:27"/> more to receive them as Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>He was informed that <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh hearing that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into <hi>Flanders,</hi> had ſaid that the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had received into his houſe a Fox that would deſtroy his Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and he took occaſion to give it out by his Emiſſaries, that his Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was fulfilled, and that the <hi>Croys</hi> had with the <hi>Dauphin</hi> conſpired the ruine of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He openly threatned to be revenged on them after the death of his Father; and ſeeing he was not as yet appeaſed when the <hi>Dauphin</hi> being become King of <hi>France</hi> left <hi>Brabant,</hi> the <hi>Croys</hi> that they might prepare for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Sanctuary, incited his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty to recover out of the hands of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Picardy</hi> lying upon the River of <hi>Soam,</hi> ſeeing the Treaty of <note n="*" place="margin">Concluded in the year 1405. betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh and <hi>Philip the good.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> allowed it upon the payment of four hundred thouſand Crowns. This was a ſaſt Sum conſidering the times: which notwithſtanding being quickly raiſed; <hi>Philip the Good,</hi> though it went againſt the grain with him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, yet durſt not refuſe it. The Towns were honeſtly reſtored; and though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53255:27"/> 
               <hi>Philip</hi>'s good will was not thereby leſſened toward the <hi>Croys,</hi> his Son made heavy complaints againſt them for it. They continued with the Father, and ſerved him faithfully ſo long as he lived; and when they perceived him brought ſo low and weak that he had but a few hours longer to live, they demanded leave of him to withdraw to their Lands in <hi>France,</hi> and obtained it. They were long perſecuted as much as lay in the power of the new Duke; nevertheleſs they ſupported it with a moderation never before practiſed on the like occaſions in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; no complaining was heard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of their mouth, nor any Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto in their favours from the Pens of their Friends. They wiſely conſidered that thoſe two ways of eaſing great Afflictions were dangerous; and that for the moſt part if thoſe who were chiefly concerned were ſo moderate as not to mingle Invectives and Satyrs in them, yet they were ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate that others did it, and that the Publick was unjuſt enough to impute them to thoſe who were not the Authors of the ſame. There appeared not ſo much as an Apology on the part of the <hi>Croys</hi> to juſtifie their innocence. They kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a profound and reſpectful ſilence; and during the Wars that followed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53255:28"/> 
               <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh their Protector, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> their declared Enemy, they neither acted againſt the King, nor againſt the Duke but on ſuch occaſions wherein they could not civilly excuſe themſelves neither to the one nor to the other. In acting, or before they acted they uſed all the circumſpection that might juſtifie their Proceeding; and though <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh was ſo difficult to be managed in that Affair, that the Conſtable of St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſucceed in it, yet they behaved themſelves ſo wiſely as that their Conduct in ſo nice a Point was not at all ſuſpected by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, They waited for the return of their good fortune in peace, and thereby deſerved that their perſeverance ſhould triumph over their adverſity. It is not known preciſely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was touched with it; or if the need he had of the <hi>Croys</hi> to get into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland,</hi> which was then made over to him by an abuſed <note n="*" place="margin">Uric Duke of Guelders.</note> Father in prejudice of his own Son<note n="†" place="margin">Adolphe.</note>, obliged him to be reconciled to them; but it is certain they were honourably re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; that they had great intereſts with the chief men of the Dutchy of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53255:28"/> 
               <hi>Guelders;</hi> that they contributed much to engage them mildly under the Dominion of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and that if the change was introduced almoſt without effuſion of bloud, <hi>Charles the Terrible</hi> was obliged to the <hi>Croys</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>They lived with him afterward in ſuch a manner, that if they gained not his friendſhip, yet they prevented the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of averſion that he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in his heart from breaking out againſt them; and after he was killed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nancy,</hi> they again advanced to the chief place of favour in the Court of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his Heireſs. They had diſpoſed her to the Marriage of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> though ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready twenty years old, and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> but ſix; and their gratitude to <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh was ſo ſincere that they omitted nothing which might ſerve to perſuade him by that Alliance to unite the Low Countries to his Family. The blindneſs and obſtinacy of that Prince in refuſing the greateſt advantage that could ever happen to him, amazed them the more, that they perceived him with extreme earneſtneſs, courting others incomparably of far leſs importance. Nevertheleſs they were not thereby diſcouraged from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging <hi>France;</hi> but managed ſo well the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53255:29"/> credit which they had with their Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that ſhe conſented to marry <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> who was afterwards the Father of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt. They ſuppoſed that if the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable hatred which <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh bore to the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſo far tranſported him, as not to admit of the Princeſs who inherited it into his Family, yet it would not carry him ſo far, as to ſuffer the Low Countries to go out of the Royal Family of <hi>France:</hi> But they had no comfort remaining, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty looked upon an Alliance of a Prince of his bloud with the Heireſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> as the greateſt misfortune that threatned <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the Intereſts that he might have, and of the Civil Wars he might raiſe therein, when he had a mind to it. They admired Divine Providence in the limits that it ſets to Monarchies, and in the obſtacles it raiſes againſt their growth and greatneſs, and ſo thwarted no more the Marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated for <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> their Son a Treaty <note n="*" place="margin">It is in the French King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</note> with the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> which confirmed the Union of <hi>Guelderland</hi> with the Low Countries; and their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53255:29"/> Affairs were in that poſture when <hi>William de Croy,</hi> Lord of <hi>Chievres,</hi> third Son of <hi>Philip de Croy,</hi> began by his rare qualities to ſignalize himſelf in the World.

The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke was a Flemming, and his Wife at her Marriage had not expreſly ſtipulated, that her rights to the Spaniſh Monarchy ſhould be reſerved to her, becauſe ſhe was ſo remote from it, that there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that ever ſhe ſhould ſucceed by the courſe of Nature: Nevertheleſs all thoſe that precluded her were dead, and made way for her Succeſſion. She had a younger Siſter in <hi>Spain;</hi> and it was to be ſeared that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> marrying her at home, might uſe the Archdutcheſs as they had heretofore treated Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Mother of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>France</hi> at the death of King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> her Father, and having neglected to get her ſelf acknowledged for Heireſs apparent, the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had diſappointed her of it, and conferred the ſame upon the Infanta <hi>Berenguelle</hi> her younger Siſter.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53255:32"/> difficult that hath appeared on the Stage in theſe latter Ages.</p>
            <p>The Archduke claimed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caſtile</hi> immediatly upon the death of his Mother-in-law, and grounded his Pretenſions upon the Right and Cuſtom received in that point all over <hi>Spain. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> the Catholick King his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, pretended on the contrary to the uſufruct and adminiſtration of the ſame Government, and ſhewed his Queens Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which leſt it to him in expreſs terms. The Archduke made anſwer that the Teſtament was forged; and that if the truth was not altogether clear on his ſide, it was at leaſt very apparent. Moſt of the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> were perſuaded of it, and publickly declared for him. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had made the reſt; and ſeeing he had beſides engaged in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts his hereditary Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon,</hi> to which his Son-in-law had no pretenſion, he would have hindered him from taking poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it to himſelf in ſpight of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, had he been engaged in a War with any of his Neighbours: whereas upon the certain advice that was brought into <hi>Spain</hi> that the adminiſtration of <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſo acceptable to the <hi>Flemings</hi> and their Neighbours, that not only neither
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53255:32"/> the one nor other had any mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet it, but were alſo diſpoſed to give the Archduke conſiderable aſſiſtances both in Men and Money upon the firſt ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſhould make for them, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> gave over his Plea, and loſt it. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, in favour of his Son-in-law, the Teſtament which he had produced, and cauſed to be Printed in all Languages: he ſigned his dimiſſion: he departed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone out of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> as he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it almoſt alone thirty four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and retreated to <hi>Arragon.</hi> But great Proſperities are many times followed by unexpected Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>The Archduke was no ſooner peaceable King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but that he died there; and that accident was ſo far from doing prejudice to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that it was the chief occaſion of his fortune. The eldeſt of the two Sons whom the Archduke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Education of this young Prince, who till the death of his Father was called Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and who afterward took the Title of Archduke, was of ſuch importance that hardly could there a man be found fit to take the care of it; and if <hi>Chievres</hi> was not called to it by the unanimous Votes of thoſe who pretended the right of appointing a Governour to the young Archduke, yet at leaſt he had this advantage, that they approved the choice that was made of him.</p>
            <p>Before we lay open ſo curious a myſtery in Politicks, it will not be amiſs to obſerve in this place that <hi>Sandoval,</hi> and other <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Hiſtorians, who have reviled the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Chievres</hi> upon the motives that

            <p>The reaſons of that diſpoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were, that on the one hand <hi>Philip</hi> underſtood the inconſtant and prodigal humour of the Emperour his Father, and knew by experience that <hi>Maximilian</hi> could no ſooner be Maſter of Money but that he ſquandered it away as faſt; and that nevertheleſs ſo ſoon as he was bare again he hunted after it with ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the other hand, the Teſtator was altogether diſſatisfied with the Catholick King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Father-in-law, and to ſay the truth, not without cauſe, ſince the affront he had received from him ſtruck directly at his honour: For when the ſame <hi>Ferdinand</hi> reſolved to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of half the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which two years before he had divided with them, he well foreſaw that his Forces being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to theirs he could not be able to overcome them but by joyning Stratagem to Force. He propoſed to himſelf to amuſe and deceive them; and that they might not miſtruſt the ſnare he laid for them, he thought it beſt to cloak his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53255:35"/> treachery under the faith of a Treaty, which is the moſt ſacred and inviolable type of Civil Society; and choſe his Son-in-law in quality of Plenipotentiary for the Inſtrument of his foul play, thinking that if the <hi>French</hi> did upon any ground conceive ſuſpicion, they would entertain leſs of a Prince, ſuch as <hi>Philip,</hi> who was their feudatary, than of any other whom his Catholick Majeſty might ſend unto them. Accordingly <hi>Ferdinand</hi> entreated <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> to go to the Court of <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, and make peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> having for that end given him an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53255:36"/> deſired, put off the Vizor. He diſowned what his Son-in-law had done, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the credulity of <hi>Louis.</hi> He ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what he had ſo unjuſtly uſurped when <hi>Philip</hi> died; who if he had left the diſpoſition of his Son to him, would have given ground of ſuſpicion that there had been a colluſion betwixt his Father in law and himſelf, and that he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent of a cheat which he or <hi>his</hi> might one day have the benefit of. His memory would have been too much blaſted thereby; and the ſtain was ſo foul, that he did not think he could ſhun it but by truſting what was deareſt to him to the Probity of <hi>Louis,</hi> and making by that means ſome reparation for the injury which he had received by his Miniſtry. Beſides, he foreſaw that if he left the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Low-Countries to the Catholick King, that Prince would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Forces againſt <hi>France</hi> with ſo much the more danger to the <hi>Flemings;</hi> that if they were worſted, he was too far off to aſſiſt them; whereas by referring himſelf to the moſt Chriſtian King in the choice of a Governour for his Son, they would remain united with <hi>France,</hi> and thereby maintain themſelves in profound peace.</p>

            <p>However it be, the <hi>Flemings</hi> approved the Teſtament of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Louis</hi> had full liberty to provide for the Education of <hi>Charles</hi> the young Archduke.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53255:38"/> which we have now mentioned, and which have been ſince objected to <hi>Charles,</hi> were already obſerved in him, or indeed that he was ſo ſoon capable of them: but that the penetrating Judgment of <hi>Chievres</hi> could even diſtinguiſh in the Soul of that young Prince his natural inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good things that charmed him, and towards the bad which were the effects of original ſin; and that perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city was in ſome meaſure like the light which directs Philoſophers in diſcovering effects in their cauſes, and Aſtronomers in finding out the inſluences in the Stars. <hi>Chievres</hi> obſerved that <hi>Charles</hi> loved glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that it was enough many times to make him amend his faults, to threaten him with divulging of them. From thence he concluded that the ſtudy and reading of Hiſtory were abſolutely neceſſary for cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the good ſeeds we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and for choaking the bad.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of thoſe two proſpects he ſearched in the Colledge of <hi>Louvain</hi> for a Tutor to the Archduke, and pitched upon Doctor <hi>Adrian</hi> who was in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation there, and who notwithſtanding his want of Politeneſs, was nevertheleſs ſince promoted to the Papacy; but in the other proſpect he was more reſerved; and there might be ground to doubt of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53255:38"/> truth of what we are about to write, if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Writers did not therein agree with the <hi>Flemings.

He convinced him at firſt of this maxim, That to ſpeak properly, there is nothing uſeleſs in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Hiſtory; and that the matters of fact which ſerve for nothing at all in the notion that one hath in reading of them, will early or late ſerve for ſomething or other in the notions that one may have hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors were already too numerous; and thoſe who have examined them in the Library of <hi>Cardinal Mazarin,</hi> know that the reading of them is not very pleaſant, to ſay nothing more ſlightingly of them. The number of <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians was not leſs: they had no Charms for that young Prince, whoſe mind was affected with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what glittered to his eyes: Nevertheleſs he run them over; and it is to be obſerved in ſeveral paſſages of his life, that he cited them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe when occaſion offered, and that he had retained what was moſt important in them.</p>
            <p>To make a deeper impreſſion of them in his mind, his Governour failed not to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53255:41"/> make him obſerve that for the moſt part all the good and bad actions of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors met with even in this life the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe or puniſhment which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; And for inſtance, that <hi>Philip the Hardy,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> becauſe of his diſſimulation in all great actions, and his pretending to have followed the Counſels of others, though no man was more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed than he of the infallibility of his own, had fallen into a quarrel with the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> his Brother, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Nephew, and left the ſame to his Poſterity, which had a long time employed, and at laſt overwhelmed him. The Exceſs of his complaiſance to the Heireſs of <hi>Flanders</hi> his Lady, becauſe of the Portion ſhe brought him, made that Princeſs, who was already but too haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, altogether inſupportable, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was even often conſtrained to bear her ſlights and affronts without daring to complain. He was ſo very revengeful, and nevertheleſs affected to appear ſo far from it, that on ſuch occaſions he always employed the hands of ſome unknown Aſſaſſins, who knew neither who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them, nor what was the reaſon of it, and God Almighty ſuffered his Son to be killed almoſt by the ſame meaſures. That <hi>John without fear</hi> was ſo perſuaded
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53255:42"/> that Fortune would change her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in his favours, that he bragged he had married her; nevertheleſs ſhe ſo far forſook him as to ſuffer him to mount a Scaffold. <note n="*" place="margin">After <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> took him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> He admired the ſimplicity of thoſe who truſted to his promiſes, and he died for having truſted to the promiſes of another. He had no more of Religion but an outſide enough to amuze good men, and he had not time enough to repent of ſo prodigious an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. By extraordinary means he courted the affection of the Common People, and loſt that of the Nobles. That <hi>Philip the good</hi> aſpired to real Grandeur, and never any Sovereign under the degree of a King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much honour as he, ſeeing he reſtored Popes, Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> By ſeveral Miſtriſſes he had nine Boys and five Girls; and by two Wives ſucceſſively during the ſpace of above fifty years, he could have but one Son who was the laſt of his Family. That in fine, <hi>Charles the Terrible</hi> ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Clergy of his Territories when he ſaw them perform Divine Service negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; and God Almighty in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the care that he took of his Glory, rendred him one of the moſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53255:42"/> famous and powerful Princes that never was King. He executed Juſtice amongſt his Subjects with an exactneſs that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently be praiſed; and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conceived ſuch veneration for him, that they could not believe that he died miſerably before <hi>Nancy</hi> as they were told, but expected him ſix years, much after the manner that the Jews expect the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> However on the other hand he was ſo cruel in War, as to be reckoned in the judgment of Poſterity the firſt Chriſtian Prince in theſe laſt Ages who limited the Law of Nations, at that time of larger extent in Military affairs than it is at preſent, reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing quarters to the conquered who with moſt profound ſubmiſſion begg'd it; and the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> who killed him, <note place="margin">In the Journal of the Siege of <hi>Neſſe.</hi>
               </note> ſo but cherouſly mangled his body that it was impoſſible afterwards to know it otherwiſe than by conjecture. He framed a deſign of reſtoring the Ancient Monarchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> upon the ruins of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>France:</hi> and he loſt himſelf in attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting it by indirect means, when he could not ſucceed in it by direct.</p>
            <p>This was the way of <hi>Chievres</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct <hi>Charles</hi> both uſefully and Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Hiſtory, by making every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable accident he learn'd contribute to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53255:43"/> the rendring him one day the better man; And <hi>Charles</hi> on his part, though he eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudied matters ſo prepared to his hand, yet did not ply his ſtudies without laying violent conſtraints upon himſelf. His thoughts were very apt to ramble, and there needed a great deal of attention to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo many different matters to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular ends, and to burden his memory with the heavy charge of uſing them in the nick of time.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53255:44"/> nevertheleſs <hi>Chievres,</hi> whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as the moſt compleat Courtier that ever was, perceiving on the one hand that his Pupil delighted in Hiſtory, and that on the other he had an averſion to the Latine Tongue, had greater regard to the inclination of his Prince, than to his own duty. That he wholly diſpenſed with his ſtudying of Latine; and allowed him to ſpend the hours that were appointed for that in Dancing, Fencing, and Riding. That <hi>Charles</hi> paid dear for that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and that when he was Emperour, he had occaſion to complain of the ſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering indulgence that his Governour had ſhowed him. That a Latine Speech was made to him one day in <hi>Germany</hi> which contained matters of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that required a ſpeedy and poſitive anſwer; and that nevertheleſs his Imperial Majeſty was ſo far from anſwering the Speech, that he underſtood it not. That he bore very impatiently the affront which at that time he received; and that wanting an opportunity of revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it upon the Perſon of <hi>Chievres</hi> who was then dead, he did it upon his mernory, which he branded with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reproach.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that the averſion of theſe Authors ſhould ſo far tranſport them as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53255:44"/> to make them heedleſly blacken <hi>Charles</hi> in the very places where they have made his Panegyrick, provided the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which they impute to him rebound upon <hi>Chievres;</hi> and for juſtifying both the one and the other, we need only diſtinguiſh what is true from what is falſe in their relation. It is true, <hi>Chievres</hi> employed <hi>Charles</hi> much more in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than in Latine: but it is not true that both theſe ſtudies were equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſhaping a young Prince; at leaſt <hi>Chievres,</hi> who without doubt paſſed for a man of Wit, Judgment, Experience, and Forecaſt, was not perſuaded of that. He thought it enough for <hi>Charles</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the dead Languages, ſuch as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and that the ſtudy of the Elegancy and Politeneſs thereof, and the opinion of ſpeaking it as it was ſpoken in <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhould be left to the ſtudy of the Criticks of Schools and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities. He was not ſingular in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and moſt part of Perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity who lived in his Age, were of the ſame. It was long after him a Maxim at the Court of <hi>France</hi> which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt poliſhed of Chriſtendom, that it was not for the honour of a King to have it ſaid of him that he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Latiniſt; and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53255:45"/> whom no man dare accuſe of ignorance in this particular, ſince <hi>Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">In the Preface to his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </note> that he had read and admired the <hi>French</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, uſed ſometimes in Raillery, to call <hi>James</hi> the Firſt of Great <hi>Britain, Maſter James,</hi> becauſe he valued himſelf too much upon his ſpeaking and writing Latine well; and it is further ſaid, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty being informed that that Prince who before was only King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was become King of <hi>England</hi> alſo, He ſpake his thoughts of it in his own words, <hi>C'ſt là un trop bon morceau pour un Pedant; That is too good a morcel for a Pedant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewiſe true, that <hi>Charles</hi> had not ſo great an inclination for the Latine Tongue as for others; but it is not ſo, that he had an averſion to it, and that <hi>Chievres</hi> condeſcended ſo far to him, as to excuſe him from learning it, ſeeing it is certain that <hi>Charles</hi> ſtudied it not after the death of <hi>Chievres;</hi> and though he would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to it, yet the great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual affairs that he had afterward, would not have allowed him the leiſure. In the mean time the <hi>Germans</hi> know that he took pleaſure in reading of <hi>Sleidan</hi> the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Latine Hiſtorian of his time; and that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53255:45"/> he uſed to ſay when he called for it, <hi>Bring me hither my Lyar;</hi> Nor are the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ignorant neither, that when he retired to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Juſt,</hi> he commonly read the Works of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> that were not then tranſlated, which ſhews that at leaſt he underſtood Latine; it being unlikely that he would loſe the time which he ſet apart wholly for working out his own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which he had bought with the price of ſo much worldly greatneſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forſaken; nor that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to jeer a Father of the Church in the ſenſe of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid on one, <hi>Non vis intelligi neque ego te intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</hi>
               </note> by reading him conſtantly without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding him.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, That Juncture, mentioned by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where <hi>Charles</hi> was put to a ſtand in <hi>Germany</hi> for want of Latine, and could neither conceive what was ſaid to him, nor make a poſitive anſwer to it, bears more than one character of falſhood: For in the firſt place, we ſee that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Latine: In the ſecond place, they who bring him in conferring immediately with a <hi>German</hi> about important affairs, know not that he never ſtooped the Imperial Majeſty ſo low; and it is ſo far from being true that he abaſed it, as is pretended, by poſitive anſwers given upon the ſpot, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53255:46"/> face to face in any matter of conſequence, that he carried it incomparably higher than any of his Predeceſſors had ever done before him, or any of his Succeſſors ſince. He heard all ſorts of buſineſs in the publick and private Audiences which he gave in <hi>Germany,</hi> without any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at the time than that he would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them; and, in truth, he took time to ſpeak of them to his Council, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve by himſelf what he was to do, there being no inſtance that ever he did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Afterward the anſwer was brought, or ſent in his name in writing to ſuch affairs as could in that manner be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for others that required anſwers by word of mouth, the Emperour ſent for thoſe who expected his anſwer, and made his Chancellour always give it them, even when he himſelf thought it convenient to be preſent. If the Chancellour was abſent or indiſpoſed, the Vice chancellour ſpake for him; and both failing, he employed a Counſellor of State. So that the paſſage related by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Writers, would have been not only irregular, but ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in its kind; and ſeeing it is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in any Author of other Nations, and that it hapned, as they would have it, in a Country far diſtant from theirs, they ought not to think it ſtrange if we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53255:46"/> queſtion the truth of their information. In the third place, there is no inſtance in latter Ages that Emperours have ſpoken Latine when they treated of affairs; and on the contrary it is very well known that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, who ſpake that Language as freely as high Dutch, yet never made uſe of it in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs. In a word, all the Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of <hi>Charles,</hi> and the moſt biting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs againſt his Memory, agree in giving him the teſtimony, that if he did not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie <hi>Chievres</hi> as much as he deſerved, yet he rewarded him after his way by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him upon all occaſions; and that he never let fall a word to his prejudice, which wholly confutes the matter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Chievres</hi> by inſtructing the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke in Hiſtory had given him thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral lights that he needed for the conduct of his life, he deſcended to particular Maxims, in laying out to him his true Intereſts in relation to all the Powers of <hi>Europe.</hi> He propoſed to him two ſorts of them; which he repreſented as not only very different in themſelves, but likewiſe in ſome manner ſo oppoſite, that he would run the risk of undoing himſelf by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the one for the other. That he had preſent intereſts and future, and that

            <p>The ſpeculations we have been ſpeaking of ought to terminate in practice; and <hi>Chievres</hi> had no ſooner by them ſhaped the mind of the Archduke, but he put the young Prince upon the practical part of what he had learn'd, though he was but as yet in the age when nothing but paſtime and recreation is talked of to thoſe of his quality. He would have him not only be preſent in his Council, but alſo that he ſhould be as aſſiduous in it, or more, than any of his Counſellours of State. He charged him with the examining of all Petitions of conſequence that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to him from the Provinces of the Low Countries, and making report of them afterward to his Council; and leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When any important diſpatch came from foreign Countries, <hi>Chievres</hi> made him lay all things aſide to read it, nay, ſo far, as that if he were aſleep, and that the matter required expedition, he awoke him, and obliged him to examine it in his preſence. If the Prince hapned to be miſtaken in the manner he underſtood it, or the Judgment he paſs'd upon it, he was immediately reproved and corrected by his Governour; and if he was ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to find out at firſt the knot of the difficulty, and the expedient for avoiding it, that did not ſerve his turn, ſeeing he muſt beſides confirm what he had ſaid by good reaſons, and anſwer pertinently to the objections which <hi>Chievres</hi> never failed to make to him.</p>
            <p>When any long Negotiation happened, and when a foreign Prince ſent an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour into the Low Countries, <hi>Charles</hi> had double fatigue, becauſe then his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour never gave Audience but in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, did nothing without him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched no buſineſs but by him. If the Embaſſadour preſented his Propoſitions in writing, <hi>Charles</hi> had the charge of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Council of them, and of declaring to them what might be ſaid for or againſt the matter, to the end that they who ſpake after him might give their opinion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53255:58"/> upon full knowledge of the Affair; and if the Embaſſadour was ſatisfied to make his Propoſals by word of mouth, and that the Affair in agitation was too ſecret to be entruſted to Paper, <hi>Charles</hi> muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber preciſely and diſtinctly what he heard, without forgetting one Syllable; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his defect of memory would have been taken notice of in full Council, and his negligence cenſured in the place where it was his greateſt ambition to purchaſe eſteem. <hi>Chievres</hi> had a care not to inform the Publick of the matters we have now repreſented, becauſe he would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the indignation of thoſe who were not ſo ſharp-ſighted as to ſee at ſo great diſtance the mark he aimed at: But it is a thing almoſt impoſſible long to conceal the manner how great Princes are Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, when it is not in all things conform to the Cuſtom practiſed in their Age. The moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth had an Affair to be concerted with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, which required to be managed by ſo much the more skilful hands that the Emperour and Catholick King were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. <hi>Hangiſt</hi> of <hi>Geulis,</hi> one of the moſt noted and underſtanding Gentlemen of <hi>Picardy</hi> was choſen to negotiate it for two reaſons, one becauſe his Perſon was acceptable to the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and the other,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53255:59"/> that being <hi>Chievres</hi> his Kinſman he might the more eaſily accord with him; but <hi>Geulis</hi> was extremely ſurpriſed when he found himſelf obliged to treat hand to hand with <hi>Charles,</hi> who was then but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old compleat. He was glad of it, nevertheleſs, at firſt, as hoping to make a better bargain of it; but when he found that the Archduke at the Age, and in the State he ſaw him in was already the ableſt Prince of his time in the Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he began to ſuſpect the evils that that might occaſion to <hi>France;</hi> and ſeeing it would not have been civil to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his thoughts as to that openly to <hi>Chievres,</hi> he only told him, that he did did not conceive why he put the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke upon ſo great an application to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, ſince it neither agreed with his tender age, his quality, conſtitution, nor the profound Peace which the Low Countries enjoyed: that the temper of that Prince was all fire, and that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious activity was a ſufficient proof of it: that nothing was ſo contrary to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that conſtitution than a too long and ſerious meditation; and ſeeing they ſpent incomparably more ſpirits than others in the exerciſe of their faculties, they proportionably wore out the Organs they made uſe of, and ſo haſtened either
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53255:59"/> their death, or from a continual ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ran into madneſs: that the latter of theſe inconveniences was the more to be feared, that in reſpect of <hi>Charles</hi> it was a Family diſtemper; and that if his Mother was troubled with it without application, he had reaſon to foreſee that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of application might produce in him the moſt terrible and moſt ignominious of its effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> gave <hi>Geulis</hi> an anſwer which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have reaſon to match with the Apophthegms of Antiquity. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he had heretofore reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that he had ſaid, and often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of it; but that after all he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that it was the chief duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him, and to which he was moſt obliged in conſcience, according to the Commiſſion given him, to put <hi>Charles,</hi> as ſoon as he could, in a condition not to ſtand in need of a Tutor; and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he muſt need one ſo long as he lived, if he did not accuſtom him in his younger years to take cognizance of his own Affairs; becauſe if they expected till he was more advanced in age, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apply himſelf to that ſo much as was neceſſary, whether that he would find himſelf at firſt overcharged with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Affairs, or that he would be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53255:60"/> diſcouraged by the pains he muſt take in determining them being but a novice therein, and by the frequent impediments they would bring in the way of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and recreations. However <hi>Chievres</hi> read in the thought of <hi>Guelis,</hi> what care ſoever he took to conceal it, that he feared the Archduke might become too know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and laboured as much as he could to divert the prejudice that might redound to the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> from the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Prince. Nay, and at firſt he ſucceeded in it pretty fortunately; and if after he was dead the affairs which he had well diſpoſed changed countenance, he is no more to be blamed for that than for the evils that hapned before he was born; and thoſe who out lived him gave him the teſtimony that if his life had been longer, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged together in War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth had no Son, and by conſequent <hi>Francis</hi> Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> firſt Prince of the Bloud Royal, was by the Law of the State next to ſucceed him. This Prince was brought up at <hi>Coignac</hi> a Town of <hi>Angumeis,</hi> but <hi>Louiſia</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> his Mother was commonly at Court. She had quarrelled with the Queen for ſome reaſons that make nothing for the clearing of this Hiſtory; and there could not be a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53255:60"/> greater miſunderſtanding betwixt two Princeſſes, than when <hi>Louis</hi> was ſo ill that the Phyſicians deſpaired of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty a few months before, had concluded two Treaties, the firſt with the Emperour <hi>Maximilian;</hi> and the ſecond with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the Catholick King: both Treaties carried in expreſs terms, <hi>That the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke</hi> Charles <hi>of</hi> Auſtria <hi>ſhould marry</hi> Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>eldeſt Daughter to the moſt Chriſtian King. France</hi> in the preſent Juncture could not receive a greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice than by that, ſeeing the Marriage agreed upon, would one day render it weaker than <hi>Spain,</hi> and by conſequent would infallibly expoſe it to ſuccumb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt War that might happen betwixt them. <hi>Bretagne,</hi> a Province of vaſt extent, and important in ſituation had for many Ages been diſmembred from the Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty had been reunited to it again. The Conduct of <hi>Philip Anguſt</hi> was ſignal in obliging the Dukes of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi> Princes of the Bloud, and of the Branch of <hi>Dieux,</hi> to perform a regular Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>France;</hi> and when the debate for that <hi>Fief</hi> aroſe betwixt <hi>John of Montfort</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Blois,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth evocated the cauſe to his Parliament, and decided it.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53255:61"/>
            <p>In a word, when there was no Males in the Houſe of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and that that Dutchy fell to Female; <hi>France</hi> by an irregular Conduct of thoſe who governed it under the Minority of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth was at the point of ſeeing that Dutchy fall into the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> unſeaſonably declared War againſt the <hi>Bretons,</hi> preſſed them with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary violence in a time when the Laws of War were as yet exactly enough obſerved, attempted to ſeize the State of their Heireſs without marrying of her, and thereby conſtrained them to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Arms of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> That young Prince by a ſtrange good luck had married the Heireſs of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and by that means deprived the <hi>French</hi> of their hopes of adding the Low Countries to their Monarchy. His Wife lived no longer than was neceſſary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the property of the Low Countries to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſeeing ſhe died within a few years after their Marriage, leaving him only one Son and one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was therefore in a condition to engage in a ſecond Marriage with the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and again to border upon <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine,</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> as he bordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by <hi>Picardy, Champagne,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy:</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:53255:61"/> That ſecond Match the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in Chriſtendom was offered to him a ſecond time, as the firſt had been, without ſuing for it, and theſe latter Ages had not produced any man ſo fortunate. It would have been folly to have refuſed a Princeſs of twelve years of age, the moſt beautiful of her time, who beſtowed her ſelf upon him to ſave her Portion; and <hi>Maximilian</hi> had wit enough to accept of her, but he wanted heat enough to go and marry her in Perſon. He was content to marry her by Proxy, and the <hi>Bretons</hi> took exceptions at that negligence. The perſon of greateſt credit amongſt them was the <hi>Mareſhal de Rieux,</hi> who had not favoured the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been ill treated by that of <hi>France.</hi> He expected that <hi>Maximilian</hi> would have come into <hi>Bretagne</hi> with Forces and Money enough to ſnatch out of the hands of the <hi>French</hi> what they had taken in the Province; but perceiving that none came in his name but one Lord, ſo ill accompanied that he durſt not make a publick entry into <hi>Reunes,</hi> and ſo beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to maintain him, he repented of what he had done, and was not long in finding out means to make reparation for his fault. He repreſented to the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53255:62"/> the errour they committed in loſing <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne</hi> by the ſame way that they had loſt <hi>Flanders:</hi> He let them know that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and defenſive Arms were uſeleſs in a Juncture when the Weapons of love could overcome: he compoſed the greateſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities on both ſides; and diſpoſed <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth not only to become <hi>Maximilians</hi> Rival, but alſo to prevent him. So that whilſt <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſollicited the Merchants of <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> to lend him money for his pretended Voyage into <hi>Bretagne, Charles</hi> went thither, won the heart of the Heireſs, baniſhed from thence, and ſupplanted <hi>Maximilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Marriage ſolemnized by both parties in Perſon, carried it over another that was on the one ſide only celebrated by Proxy: &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> poſſeſſed the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne</hi> and her Country peaceably. He had three Boys by her, who all died Children; and <hi>Louis</hi> XII. who ſucceeded him, married his Widow as much through inclination as reaſon of State. He had indeed the greateſt Civil Intereſt to preſerve <hi>Bretagne,</hi> but beſides he had loved the Heireſs; and his flame was eaſily kindled again, though ſeven years of impriſonment had been uſed to extinguiſh it. They add, that he was reciprocally beloved, and that the Widow of <hi>Charles the Eighth</hi> comforted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53255:62"/> her ſelf for the loſs of him, in hopes that ſhe ſhould ſtill reign in <hi>France.</hi> She was not miſtaken in her opinion; and <hi>Louis</hi> that he might enjoy her the more ſpeedily, knowing that the diſpenſation to marry her had been granted him, ſtayed not till the Legate delivered it into his hands. He took the ſtart and married; and the two Daughters which he ſoon had, perſuaded him of a numerous Poſterity, and that after the Girls he would have Boys. Truſting to that ſuppoſition he had twice promiſed his eldeſt Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Grandſon of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture was only verified in part. His Wife was brought to bed of ſome Male Children, but they died almoſt as ſoon as they were born, and he had none remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive but his two Daughters. Reaſons of State and <hi>Decorum</hi> required that the Count of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> ſhould marry the Eldeſt, and the honeſt <hi>Frenchmen</hi> preſſed the King to it; but the Queen had got ſo great an aſcendant over the mind of her Husband as to keep him from diſpoſing of his Daughter to any perſon without her conſent. The hopeful and lovely preſence of the young Count was not diſagreeable to her, and beſides in that particular ſhe was inclinable enough to the Intereſts of <hi>France:</hi> but the rebounds of the hatred
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53255:63"/> of women commonly go farther than thoſe of men. The averſion of the Queen to the Counteſs of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> rebounded in a very ſtrange and odd manner upon the Count her Son; and her Majeſty made no account of the ſingular qualities which diſtinguiſhed him from other Princes of his age, and procured him the admiration of the People. She only conſidered him in the natural relation and affection he had to the Counteſs; and as ſhe was not ignorant of the deference that he had for his Mother, ſo ſhe thought of nothing for the future but that when he was King, he would give her a great deal of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the State; and that ſo after the death of <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, the Counteſs would have as much credit, as the Queen had had during his life. Ambitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple behold nothing with ſo jealous eyes, as thoſe who are like to ſupplant them; and the Queen was in that diſquiet condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind at the time the King was ſo ill, that the Phyſicians deſpaired of his recovery. It is not certain whether the Queen obliged them to conceal nothing from her of what they thought of him, or that ſhe ſuſpected the worſt: but it is certain that ſhe took the ſame meaſures as if ſhe had been perſuaded of it. She durſt not, or would not forſake a Husband that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53255:63"/> had been ſo loving to her, but ſhe dreaded as the greateſt of miſeries to fall into the hands of the Counteſs. Yet her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty could not avoid it if her eldeſt Daughter continued in <hi>France</hi> until the death of the King, ſeeing his Succeſſour would not ſuffer her to depart out of the Kingdom, but would marry her. So ſhe reſolved to remove her before, and ſend her into <hi>Bretagne,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>he might diſpoſe of her according to her humour by marrying her to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke of the Low Countries, and by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by virtue of that Alliance an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that might torment the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in ſuch a manner that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs ſhould not get much by her Sons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming King.</p>
            <p>The Court was at <hi>Blois,</hi> and it was not far from thence to <hi>Bretagne;</hi> but moſt part of women are covetous and near, and thereby often loſe the occaſion of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting great deſigns. The fourteen Dukes of <hi>Bretagne</hi> had for the moſt part been magnificent, and had left a vaſt quantity of moſt rich furniture. The Queen had cauſed it to be tranſported into <hi>France,</hi> and could not reſolve to leave it there leſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs might make uſe of it, and at her coſt live in the <hi>luxury,</hi> wherein ſhe ſo much delighted. That conſideration preſerved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53255:64"/> 
               <hi>Bretagne</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it hindered the Queen from ſending her Daughter by Land with a ſtrong Guard that could not be ſtopt.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty thought it neceſſary that the young Princeſs ſhould depart with the Baggage, to the end that the reſpect which would be ſhewn her might keep it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſearched; and ſeeing it was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently concealed neither as to the quantity nor value when carried by Land in Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, it was thought more convenient to ſend it in Boats by Water: but it ſeldom happens that one woman ſurpriſes another that miſtruſts her; and the Queen ſtood in need of too many people to keep her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hid ſo long as would have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs was punctually informed of all; and ſeeing her Son was under age, and that ſhe expected to be Regent if at that time he had hapned to be King, ſhe thought ſhe might lawfully anticipate the function in a Juncture that could not be more important. All the Courtiers who were of the humour to prefer the riſing Sun before the ſetting were her friends, and amongſt theſe was the Mareſchal <hi>de</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Gie. Gie</hi> was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Courtier, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of two ſucceſſive
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53255:64"/> Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, which was rare, and without loſing the good opinion which the Publick conceived of his probity during his two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold favour, which is rarer ſtill. He was a great lover of his Country; and if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore he was the cauſe that the <hi>French</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Fornona</hi> did not cut in pieces all the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces who attempted to hinder their paſſage, it was becauſe he thought the Conquerours could not gain ſo much by far in obtaining a total Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as they might loſe in the ſequel of the fight by reaſon of the perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, who was too deeply engaged in the Conflict. He knew that the Queen deſigned her Daughter for the Archduke, and was ſenſible of what conſequence it would be for the Kingdom to fruſtrate the accompliſhment of it. So the Counteſs had no ſooner given him notice that Madam was embarked, and ſollicited him to ſtop her as ſhe paſſed through his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but that he conſented to it, though he foreſaw the troubleſom conſequences of ſo bold an enterpriſe in their full extent.</p>
            <p>He omitted nothing that might ſweeten the bitterneſs of it: His reſpects were moſt profound in diverting Madam from proſecuting her Journey: He uſed her and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53255:65"/> thoſe of her retinue with extraordinary civility: he contracted debts to defray her charges with greater Magnificence, which afterwards encumbred his Eſtate; but, to be ſhort, if he ſerved the Counteſs in what ſhe moſt deſired, he provoked the Queen in the point ſhe was moſt ſenſible in, and rendered her irreconcilable to him. Her Majeſty took it ſo ill that a <hi>Breton,</hi> born her Subject, and deſcended of a Family ſo often allied to the Houſe of <hi>Dreux</hi> ſhould dare to oppoſe what ſhe moſt ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that at the very inſtant ſhe ſwore ſhe would be his ruine, and endeavoured to be as good as her word upon the firſt occaſion that offered.</p>
            <p>The King contrary to all expectation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and by inceſſant importunities ſhe forced that good Prince to abandon his Favourite. <hi>Gie</hi> was brought to a trial, <note place="margin">In the Memoires of <hi>Bretagne.</hi>
               </note> and it appears in the Papers of the Chamber of accounts of <hi>Bretagne</hi> that the Queen laid out 35000 Livers for carrying on his Proceſs, which at that time was a vaſt Sum: in the mean time ſhe had but half of her revenge, and the Mareſhal was only ſentenced to be baniſhed, and to end his days in the lovely Houſe of <hi>Verger,</hi> ſeated in the ſame Province of <hi>Anjou,</hi> where he had the unhappineſs to diſpleaſe the Queen.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53255:65"/>
            <p>The Counteſs nevertheleſs obtained her ends, ſeeing the chief Perſons of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being aſſembled by the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, preſented to his Majeſty a moſt humble and judicious Petition. They earneſtly begg'd of him to grant his loyal Subjects the favour which they moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and with great Juſtice deſired, which was the marriage of Madam his Daughter with the Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> to the end that that Princeſs being one day to inherit in full the Dutchy of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and her younger Siſter having no claim but to a very little ſhare in the other Eſtates of her Mother, which might be valued at a Sum of Mony, the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince might be ſo incorporated with the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, that for the future it could not be diſmembred from it, though the moſt Chriſtian Kings ſhould leave none but Daughters. The Juncture was favourable, ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> demanded nothing of <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth but what he could honeſtly and with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence grant. The Emperour and Catholick King were the firſt that had violated the Treaty which promiſed Madam to their Grandſon; and their prevarication in that point was ſo evident, that all the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Europe</hi> were convinced of it.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53255:66"/> of his Oaths, liſtened to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs with his accuſtomed goodneſs, and paſs'd his word that Madam ſhould marry the Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> and that the Marriage ſhould be conſummated ſo ſoon as ſhe was of age. The Queen, who could neither break nor defer a reſolution which was ſo odious to her, promiſed her ſelf to fruſtrate the accompliſhment of it; and they who knew how eaſily the King had ſacrificed to her his Favourite, thought that ſhe propoſed nothing in that beyond her power, but the Counteſſes good fortune levelled that difficulty when at Court it ſeemed to be inſuperable. The Queen who in all appearance, and according to all the Rules of Phyſick was like to out-live the King, and to hold out to an extreme old age, nevertheleſs died before him at the age of thirty ſeven years. The Counteſs found no more oppoſition to her deſigns at Court: The Friends of the Queen courted her favour; and ſhe was preſented with what fitted her beſt of the Furniture and Rarities of the Houſe of <hi>Bretagne.</hi> Her Son married Madam; and that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs entertained as great an affection for her Husband as poſſible could be, though like that of moſt part of other women, it bordered not upon Jealouſie.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53255:66"/>
            <p>Moſt of the particulars we have now related, hapned before <hi>Chievres</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to <hi>Charles;</hi> and thoſe who before him were about that young Prince failed not to repreſent to him upon all occaſions according to the Orders they had received from his two Grandfathers, that the Count of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> in taking his Wife from him had done him an irreparable injury. That it was an affront not to be ſuffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infamy, nor revenged but by the bloud of him that had given it. That, the truth was, the Count was at that time below the anger of the Archduke, being but as yet a private perſon; but that he would not be always ſo, and that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>France</hi> look'd upon him as Heir apparent. That when once he was King, he ought to call him to an account by the way of Arms, which was the only courſe Sovereigns had when they intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Perſons of their own quality to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that in the mean time it would be a diſgrace to the Archduke to entertain any communication with him. That he ought not to propoſe to himſelf the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Grandfather, who ſhewed no reſentment but in word, when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth robbed him of his Wife <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> for it was not for want of courage that <hi>Maximilian</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53255:67"/> ſuffered it, but out of an abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of revenging himſelf in that he was under the power of a Father when the injury was done to him. That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third his Father, one of the moſt husbanding Princes that ever was, refuſed to furniſh him with Money and Forces for that purpoſe; and that the <hi>Flemings</hi> his Sons Subjects would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the quarrel of a Prince whom they look'd upon as a ſtranger, ſince his Wife was dead, and that he was no more but the Father of their Sovereign. That after the death of <hi>Frederick</hi> when <hi>Maximilian</hi> had ſucceeded, the occaſion of revenge was loſt by the Apoplexy which carried <hi>Charles</hi> out of the world at the age of twenty eight years, but that the caſe was not alike neither in regard of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, nor in regard of the Count of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouleſm.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Towards the end of <hi>Philip de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</hi>
               </note> That the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke was already Maſter of the Low Countries. That his Subjects had ſo great a love for him that they would ſpend part of their Eſtates and their bloud in the quarrel: That he would not want neither <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, nor <hi>German</hi> Soldiers; and that, in ſhort, the Count was of too ſtrong a conſtitution to give any ground to fear that he would die before the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53255:67"/> had had the ſatisfaction he deſired of him.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſcourſes ſuiting with the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humour of <hi>Charles,</hi> and reiterated to him in an Age wherein the ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that then are made commonly laſt as long as life, had produced their effect, and ſo animated the Archduke againſt the Count, that he was impatient not to be in a condition of entering the Liſts againſt his Adverſary; when <hi>Crievres</hi> foreſaw the troubleſom conſequences that an enmity cultivated with ſo much care might have, and thought it neceſſary to remedy it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though he made no doubt but that the Emperour and Catholick King would take it ill at his hands, and prove his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies if he ſucceeded in it.</p>
            <p>He had formerly been acquainted in the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Artas de Gouſſier</hi> Lord of <hi>Boiſly,</hi> Governour to the Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> and reckoned him the fitteſt man of the Kingdom for the Commiſſion that was given him. He was perſuaded of his great integrity, and promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from that to be ſeconded in the deſign of contracting a Friendſhip betwixt the Archduke and the Count, which might procure to both a long repoſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>French</hi> the peace which they enjoyed. He ſollicited him to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53255:68"/> this by ways that are not known: but it is to be believed that it was done without engaging the Archdukes honour, and ſo prudently that neither the Count nor his Governour might draw any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from it, in caſe the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had not ſucceded. <hi>Gouſſier</hi> on his part contributed thereto all that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and laboured much to blot out of the Count's mind the dangerous impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Archduke which were ſtamp'd in it, as if he had been his moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy, whilſt <hi>Chievres</hi> on the other ſide acted efficaciouſly with the Archduke in convincing him by ſtrong reaſons that the injuries of Princes were not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Standard of private perſons; and that he neither could nor ought to take it ill if the Count had done to him what he would have done to the Count, if he had been in his place.</p>
            <p>When the reſentment was ſtifled on the one hand, and diffidence removed on the other, the two Governours ſought an occaſion to ſettle a commerce by Letters betwixt their two Princes, which might entertain and encreaſe their good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and took the firſt favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that offered. Mere chance brought it ſo about that it was on the Archdukes ſide, and that he needed the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53255:68"/> offices of the Count in an affair of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in the Provinces of <hi>Flanders, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> fair remains of vaſt Eſtates which thoſe of his Family had purchaſed there; had ſo far inſinuated himſelf into the favours of the Archduke, that he would have been his Favourite if that Prince had been of an humour to have any, and that to caution himſelf againſt that he had not taken the ſame meaſures almoſt, which chaſt men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make uſe of to fortifie themſelves againſt the lovely eyes of a Lady whom they are afraid to be ſmitten with; he ſtudied, and played with his Maſter; and <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſo far from oppoſing that he contributed to it, becauſe making it his buſineſs to place about the Archduke young Lords who might not corrupt the good ſeeds that he endeavoured to plant in him, he thought <hi>Naſſau</hi> not only one according to his mind, but that alſo he might be uſeful in confirming the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke in the exerciſes of virtue; by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> relations courted for him <hi>Elizabeth of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53255:69"/> Siſter to the Prince of <hi>Aurange.</hi> The Alliance was ſutable, and could not cauſe any umbrage; for beſides that the Families of <hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> had full liberty to marry one with another without diſpleaſing their Sovereigns, if the Houſe of <hi>Chalon</hi> had a great Eſtate in the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it had more in the <hi>French County,</hi> and upon that account paſſed rather for a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> than <hi>French</hi> Family. All the difficulty lay in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the conſent of the King <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, without which the Father of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had diſcharged her to be given in marriage; and there was but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that his Majeſty would give it in favours of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> ſeeing it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reaſon of State. Prince <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libert</hi> of <hi>Chalon,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was the only Male of his Family. He gave no promiſes of a long life in his youth, though afterward be became very ſtrong, and Politicians looked upon his Siſter already as the richeſt Heireſs in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> If <hi>Naſſau</hi> married her he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon powerfully ſetled in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who would not change his Maſter though the Succeſſion of <hi>Aurange</hi> ſhould fall to his Wife, and would ſpend in the Archdukes ſervice the Revenue of the fair Eſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Chalon</hi> in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53255:69"/> 
               <hi>France:</hi> whereas if the King gave to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Husband, the Eſtate would not go out of the Kingdom as neither to the rents nor property, and the Husband would employ them in the ſervice of his Majeſty. There needed then a ſtrong recommendation to the King to prevail with him, and <hi>Chievres</hi> adviſed <hi>Naſſau</hi> to pray the Archduke that in this proſpect he would employ the intereſt of the Count of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> with the King his Father-in-law. The Archduke wrote ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly to the Count about it; and that Prince prepared by <hi>Gouſſier</hi> anſwered the Archduke in the ſame ſtile. And ſeeing he already gloried in a generoſity too high for the Age he lived in, he granted more than was demanded of him, and ſurmounted an obſtacle which <hi>Naſſau</hi> had not foreſeen. He thought it not enough to have obtained his Majeſties conſent, but further won the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> in favours of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> who had, and always would have oppoſed him, if the Count had not concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it. There had been an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom amongſt the four chief Houſes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which were <hi>Neuchatel, Vienne, Vergy,</hi> and <hi>Chalon,</hi> which in ſome manner reſembled the agreement of ſome Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Families in <hi>Germany</hi> touching their reciprocal Succeſſion.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53255:70"/>
            <p>The cuſtom was that when any one of the four was in danger of being extinct it contracted no Alliance but with that of the three others which it liked beſt, that the Eſtates of both might be joyned. Now the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in down right honeſty to follow the example of his Anceſtors. In the Houſe of <hi>Vienne</hi> there was a young Lord who in all things almoſt ſympathized with him in humour. He loved him entirely; and deſigned his Siſter for him upon the ſame conſideration that he would have made him his Heir, if ſhe died before him. Nevertheleſs the Count of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> made his application to him in ſo taking a way, and ſo dextrouſly inſinuated the pleaſure he would do him in giving him an opportunity of obliging the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke in a thing that he ſeemed cordially to be concerned in, that the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> to comply with him ſtrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extremely. He broke the cuſtom we have been ſpeaking of, and ſlighted the Lord of <hi>Vienne</hi> whom already he had treated as his Brother-in-law. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Marriage of his Siſter with <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and laid the foundation of the greatneſs to which that Houſe has been ſince advanced. The Archduke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon teſtified all the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53255:70"/> to the Count of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> that <hi>Gouſſier</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> expected from him. He thanked him for it by Letters: He ſent time after time Gentlemen to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a commerce with him: careſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily thoſe whom the Count ſent to him again; and that correſpondence was not as yet interrupted, when the Count ſucceeded to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth: but the cementing of that perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we have been ſpeaking of was not the chief buſineſs of <hi>Chievres</hi> out of the Low Countries.</p>
            <p>There were two others which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his more aſſiduous care, and troubled him moſt of any thing when the leaſt irregularity was committed in them. And that was the friendſhip of the two Grandfathers of the Archduke, the more difficult to be entertained, that ſeeing theſe Princes were of a quite contrary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, it was abſolutely neceſſary to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a different conduct with them, and nevertheleſs from that diverſity both took occaſion at every turn to complain of their Grandſons Governour; for though their Atipathy could not be greater than it was, yet they expected to be treated after the ſame manner. The Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> was inſatiable as to money, and pretended that men ſhould find it for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53255:71"/> him as eaſily as he ſpent it. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick King husbanded his Revenues ſo frugally that he paſſed for covetous in the thoughts of thoſe who knew not that he had not the fourth part of what was neceſſary for the carrying on of his vaſt deſigns. He no ſooner came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Emperour's wants were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with money from the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but that he repreſented his own to <hi>Chievres,</hi> and deſired his aſſiſtance. It did not ſerve <hi>Chievres</hi> his turn to lay before him that the Revenues of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries could not ſuffice both the Emperour and him, becauſe then he ſpake no more of money indeed; but inſtead of that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Archduke to engage in his quarrels. It lay upon <hi>Chievres</hi> then to conſider in the impoſſibilities he ſaw himſelf in to comply with their Imperial and Catholick Majeſties at the ſame time; which of the two Friendſhips it would be moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for the Archduke, that his Governour entertained.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons for the Emperour were, that if <hi>Chievres</hi> reſolved not to live with him in a moſt ſtrict union, that Prince who could not endure to perplex his mind with the thoughts of what was to come; and who forecaſt no farther for the future, than what his preſent profit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53255:71"/> him to, would inſenſibly diſcontinue to entertain the Party made in the Empire for the election of his Grandſon in his place, and would give occaſion to the Electors who favoured the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> to change ſides when they found themſelves ſlighted: Beſides if ſome time or other the <hi>French</hi> ſhould have a mind to attack the Low Countries, it would be impoſſible for the Catholick King to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from conquering them, and the Emperour alone would be capable to croſs their deſign. In the mean while, if he were ſlighted by the Archduke upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſtriking in elſewhere; He would not do it, conſidering the temper he was of eaſie to be diſguſted, and more eaſie ſtill to puſh on to the utmoſt extremities the diſguſt which once he conceived; and though he would do it, yet he could not be any more in a condition, ſeeing the <hi>Germans</hi> who eſteemed him not ſo much for his perſonal qualities as for the profit they were ſure to make of him when they were ſo happy as to be at Court when money came in, would no ſooner ſee the fountain head dried up by the cutting off his regular Supplies from <hi>Flanders,</hi> but they would begin to ſlight him, and take no more care of arming for him, nor of bringing Forces to his ſervice when he deſired it: whereas
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53255:72"/> if his Grandſon's Purſe were kept open to him for the future, as it had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would produce this odd effect, that the vice of one man would be the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Family from which he ſprung. That the prodigality of <hi>Maximilian</hi> would become magnificence in the deſign of thoſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in that it ſerved to continue the Empire in their Family; and that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would liſt themſelves as readily, and with as little ſcruple mount on horſeback to follow the Emperour into the Low Countries, as they did when he ſollicited them to accompany him in the War againſt the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons that made for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King in the mind of <hi>Chievres,</hi> were that the Archduke had incomparably more to hope for, and more to fear from him than from the Emperour. His hopes were manifeſt, grounded upon the Crowns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as well in <hi>Spain</hi> as in <hi>Italy</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Africa.</hi> The fear was more hid, but the ſubject of it was neither ſmaller nor leſs infallible. It conſiſted in this, That the Archduke, indeed, expected no other Inheritance of his Grandfather by the Fathers ſide but the ten Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> but that Inheritance was of ſuch a nature that he could no ways be diſappointed of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53255:72"/> it, provided he out-lived his Grandfather, and that that Prince never diſpoſed of him to his prejudice, neither by Donation, Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor Exchange. The Laws of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> confirmed by all the Emperours who reigned ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in all the general Diets aſſembled ſince that time, bore in expreſs terms, <hi>That the Imperial fees did ſo certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Males of the Houſe that held them, and had once received inveſtiture of them, that it was not in the power of the Feudatary for any cauſe or pretext that might be to fruſtrate his eldeſt Son, or the Male Children of that eldeſt Son by giving them to his other Children, nor to deprive the Paternal Couſins, how remote ſoever, of the ſame, in favours of their own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Conſtant and uninterrupted cuſtom had exactly agreed with theſe Laws, and no inſtance could be given that they had ever been violated as to that particular in whole, or in part.</p>
            <p>It was not ſo in the Succeſſion which the Archduke expected from the Catholick King, and he had more reaſons than one to fear that he might be diſappointed of it, though at firſt view it appeared to be full as ſure as that of the Emperour. For in the firſt place <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſufficiently teſtified his diſpleaſure that his Dominions
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53255:73"/> one day ſhould fall to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by omitting nothing that could naturally be done to prevent it. He acted not with ſo much ſincerity as the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Son <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain.</hi>

               </note> of the Emperour; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Maximilian</hi> had given him an only Daughter, he had only given to <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> for <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> the ſecond of his four Daughters. The Eldeſt he married in <hi>Portugal;</hi> ſhewing by ſo publick a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that he had rather his Succeſſion ſhould deſcend upon a Prince whoſe Grandfather was a Baſtard, and great Grandmother the Daughter of a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker Jew, than be wanting in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to remove his Son-in-Law the Archduke <hi>Philip</hi> from the ſucceſſion to the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His forecaſt nevertheleſs was vain, and in a very few years the Emperours Sons Wife became Heir apparent of ſo many Kingdoms. Any but the Catholick King would in ſo ſudden a revolution have adored the Order of Divine Providence, and wholly ſubmitted to it: Nevertheleſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53255:73"/> that Prince oppoſed it by a longer and more ſteady obſtinacy than that of <hi>Jonas</hi> in declining to go to <hi>Niniveh.</hi> His Wife was no ſooner dead, but that he married another in the ſole proſpect of having a Son by her, and becauſe he drew towards fifty years of age, and that the diſorders of his youth gave him ground at that age to diſtruſt his own vigour, he had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Phyſick, and took Potions that were thought fit to ſupply that defect. In the ſecond place, the Catholick King had luſty handſome Baſtards; and if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them before the Children of his lawful Daughter in ſucceeding to the Throne, he would in that do nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary neither to the Cuſtom of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the inclination of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It was no new thing in that Country, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt of <hi>Europe</hi> on the <hi>Affrican</hi> ſide, to promote Baſtards to the Throne in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lawful Children, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf deſcended in right Line from <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, who was a Baſtard. There was beſides another inſtance of that irregularity in his Family; For his Uncle <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> his Father, dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Children, by Teſtament which in that part was executed, fruſtrated <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and left it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53255:74"/> to a Baſtard whom he had by a Perſon of quality, Educated in that proſpect. In the third place, the Catholick King could not only take from the Archduke <hi>Arragon</hi> and the Crowns that depended upon it; but alſo he might by the way we ſhall now treat of hinder him from reigning in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and in the Monarchies annexed to it. This young Prince drew his Title to <hi>Caſtile</hi> from Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother by the Mothers ſide; and yet that Princeſs had not inherited it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence, and encroaching upon the moſt ſacred and inviolable Laws of Civil Society. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, her Brother, King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> married the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that <hi>Infanta</hi> during his marriage with her was brought to bed of a Daughter, the moſt beautiful, as they ſay, that ever was born in <hi>Spain.</hi> This Daughter by the Fundamental Laws of the State excluded her Aunt from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeeding to ſo many Kingdoms, becauſe ſhe was neareſt by a degree, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her Father: Nevertheleſs the Aunt pretended that her Brother was impotent; and that the Daughter that was fathered on him, was begotten by his Favourite <hi>Don Bertram de la Cueva,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> For that reaſon, or under that pretext ſhe made a great
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53255:74"/> Party, and raiſed a War in <hi>Caſtile:</hi> But the Party of the Daughter proving the ſtronger, the Aunt had her recourſe to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and gave her ſelf to him, having no other way to engage him to eſpouſe her intereſt againſt her Neece. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> having married the Aunt tranſported all the Forces of <hi>Arragon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He overcame them who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his Wives Neece, and diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her of the Kingdom: But was now in a condition to repay the injury which he had done her, by recalling her into <hi>Caſtile</hi> where he had the Power, raiſing her to the Throne, and marrying her to one of his Baſtards.</p>
            <p>Upon the Reaſons we have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Chievres</hi> made the reflections they deſerved. He long conſidered with himſelf the prejudice that might befal the Archduke by not entertaining an entire correſpondence with his maternal Grandfather: Nevertheleſs having put into the balance together the hurt that might redound to that Prince by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>France</hi> during his minority, if he Leagued too ſtrictly with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King; and the injury the Catholick King might do him, if he united not ſo cloſely with him, he found the firſt alone to weigh far more than all the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53255:75"/> others put together, and by the boldeſt reſult of prudence that is to be found in the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> he judged it to be avoided rather than the reſt. He kept the Archduke in friendſhip with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> He thought it enough not to give the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King any cauſe or pretext to complain of him in particular; and in the following Books we ſhall find that his conduct in that point was as fortunate, as it had been judicious.</p>

               <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh had bought of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Father of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the Contract of Engagement.</note> the two Counties by a Contract of Engagement which bore that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould lend upon the Counties three hundred thouſand Livers: that both ſhould be put into his hands for ſecurity of the debt; That the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> ſhould have full liberty to redeem them within nine years to be reckoned from the Date of the Contract, upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Principal and Intereſt; but that if he failed upon any cauſe or pretext whatſoever to do it within the limited time, he ſhould loſe his reverſion, and the propriety of <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> and <hi>Cerdagne</hi> ſhould remain to <hi>France.</hi> The King of <hi>Arragon</hi> let the time clapſe through a mere inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of redeeming the Counties; and <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh perceiving the ninth year almoſt expired without any offer from the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> of repaying his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, obſerved a formality, which was not neceſſary, and ſerved only to give him what in Law is called <hi>abundantiam Juris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He cauſed the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> to be ſummoned by a Herald to redeem the Counties; and that Prince not having done it, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty united them
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53255:77"/> to the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, and left them at his death to <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth his only Son. <hi>Charles</hi> had been already nine years in peaceable poſſeſſion of them; and ſeeing by the Law of his State what had been united ten whole years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively could not for the future be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> and <hi>Cerdagne</hi> were no more alienable than the other Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing two moſt Chriſtian Kings had enjoyed them without moleſtation during the ſpace of thirty years. But it had pleaſed <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh to bring up <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth in ſuch a groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he had no knowledge of his own affairs; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> taking that young Prince on his weak ſide, corrupted, as they ſay, by money <hi>Oliver Maillard</hi> a Monk of the obſervance his Confeſſor. That <hi>Cordelier</hi> repreſented to <hi>Charles,</hi> that Chriſtian Charity allowed not Chriſtians of what quality ſoever they were to take advantage from the misfortunes of others, and that notwithſtanding that was a thing which the late King had done, and which his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty continued to do. That when <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh had cauſed the late King of <hi>Arragon</hi> to be ſummoned to repay the money lent upon the Counties of <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> and <hi>Cerdagne,</hi> he found him in an utter incapacity of ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53255:77"/> him, and that nevertheleſs his Majeſty had therefrom taken all the advantages that are allowed by the Law of Nations: That the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was at that time peſtered in a Civil War and a Foreign War both at once; ſeeing on the one hand the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> incomparably ſtronger than he, had entered his Dominions with an Army, and on the other hand the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians</hi> had revolted: That his Majeſty of <hi>Arragon</hi> died before theſe Affairs were concluded, and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Son was no more in a condition than he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the two Counties, ſince he was forced to employ all his own Revenue and that of the Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> his Wife for driving the Mahometan Moors out of the Kingdom of <hi>Granada;</hi> and that by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the preſcription expired not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him, becauſe he was taken up in a Holy War: That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty therefore was no leſs obliged in conſcience to reſtore him the Counties; and that though in the Court of Man he had a very good right to demand the Money and the Intereſt of the Debt which his Predeceſſor had lent; yet he had not ſo in the Court of Heaven, ſince <hi>France</hi> had recovered more out of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than amounted to the firſt Sum lent: That he muſt not neither make deduction
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53255:78"/> of the Expences that the late moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King was forced to be at in raiſing an Army of forty thouſand men even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and ſending them into <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> for the reduction of the Town of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan</hi> that had revolted: That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of that important place ought neither to be imputed to the late King of <hi>Arragon</hi> who had no hand in it, nor to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Son that had neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly countenanced it; and that ſo <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> and <hi>Cerdagne</hi> ought without farther delay to be reſtored to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> who was not ſharp-ſighted enough to diſtinguiſh the truth from the falſhood in this Diſcourſe of his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, obeyed the Father, but not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely as the <hi>Cordelier</hi> pretended he ſhould. His Majeſty, indeed, reſtored the Counties without receiving either Principal or Intereſt of the money disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Father, but in return he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired two conditions of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> which would have been no leſs troubleſom to him than the payment of the money, had they been as faithfully performed as they were ſtipulated in a ſolemn Treaty<note n="*" place="margin">In the laſt Treaty of <hi>France</hi> for the Counties.</note>. The firſt was that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould enter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53255:78"/> into no League offenſive or defenſive againſt <hi>France;</hi> the other, that he ſhould not marry any of his four Daughters neither in <hi>Germany, England,</hi> nor <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and that he ſhould not give them any Husbands without the conſent of the moſt Chriſtian King or his Succeſſours; but before a year was over <hi>Ferdinand</hi> broke the firſt condition, and made no more ſcruple afterward to violate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Six months after, he entered into the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> League of <hi>Italy</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> his Benefactor, and had the greateſt hand in robbing him of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Not long after he formed the project of hedging in <hi>France</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Picardy, Champagne,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> as he bordered it already on the ſide of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> and made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of bringing into his Family the Low Countries, and the ten Hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> That Houſe was reduced to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt the Emperour, the Archduke <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Archdutcheſs <hi>Margaret</hi> his Children. The Archduke was ſo tender, and had coſt ſo much pains in cockering him during his infancy, that there was no great appearance he could live long enough to beget Children. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutcheſs, on the contrary, was the moſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53255:79"/> vigorous and jolly Princeſs of her Age; and the Phyſicians were free enough to ſay that ſhe would carry with her the rich Succeſſions of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> to the Family ſhe married into, beſides a numerous Off-ſpring of which ſhe gave no ſmall hopes. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that to get her into his Family, and for that end laid the moſt Artificious and ſelfiſh Scheme that can be found in the Records of <hi>Spain.</hi> He had one Son and four Daughters, the Sons name was <hi>John,</hi> from the Grandfather by the Father's ſide, his eldeſt Daughters name was <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the ſeconds <hi>Jane,</hi> the thirds <hi>Mary,</hi> and the youngeſts <hi>Catharine.</hi> The fundamental Laws of <hi>Spain</hi> gave to the Son all the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> which his Father poſſeſſed, and all the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> that his Mother had brought with her in Marriage, his four Siſters having no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to any part of them; and if he died without Children, the eldeſt of his Siſters was to ſucceed him in full without ſharing any thing with the younger. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> was very willing that the States of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> might enter into his Family, but he would not have his own and Wifes Kingdoms to go into a foreign Houſe. That inconvenience ſeemed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible unto him, and he thought to remedy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53255:79"/> it by offering only to <hi>Maximilian</hi> his ſecond Daughter for the Archduke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all humane probability the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Infanto of <hi>Spain</hi> with the Archdutcheſs could not be barren; and though by the greateſt miſchance ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable it ſhould happen to be ſo, yet that of the eldeſt of the Infanta's of <hi>Spain,</hi> deſigned for <hi>Manuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> might not be, and by conſequent if the Succeſſion of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> went out of the Houſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> it would not go out of <hi>Spain,</hi> which by that means would be almoſt united into one ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. His Catholick Majeſty then cauſed a double Alliance to be propoſed to the Emperour with this diſproportion, that his only Son ſhould marry the only Daughter of his Imperial Majeſty, and that nevertheleſs the only Son of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty ſhould marry but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his Daughters. The Propoſition was in it ſelf ridiculous as contrary to the rules of Decency, the advantage not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to both ſides, and nothing as yet preſſing <hi>Maximilian</hi> to marry his Children: It was nevertheleſs accepted by an extraordinary diſpoſition of Divine Providence, which intended to raiſe the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by ways unknown to <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53255:80"/> thought he had in that double Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Catholick King ſuch as we have mentioned it to be, a preſent intereſt which he could find no where elſe; and which was ſtrong enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him.</p>
            <p>We have already ſpoken of his eager deſire of money, and how it could not ſtay with him. He was aſſured of raiſing three conſiderable Sums out of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and of the Low Countries. The two firſt Sums were to be given him as a Preſent for the Marriages of the Archduke and Archdutcheſs, and the laſt for the Portion of the ſaid Archdutcheſs. He got all clear to himſelf without disburſing a Penny, ſeeing in the Affair then in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Portions of the two Archdutcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes went in exchange for one another, and that beſides he had no charges almoſt at all to be put to, there being but very little Magnificence at that time in the Court of <hi>Spain:</hi> whereas if the Emperour ſettled his Son and Daughter in any other Family of <hi>Europe,</hi> firſt, he would not find a double Alliance to be made, and beſides, nothing of what the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> might give would come into his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. In the ſecond place, the Charges of the Weddings would not be ſpared, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53255:80"/> the Emperour could have no pretext to excuſe him from it.</p>
            <p>The Subjects of his Imperial Majeſty and of the Archduke acted not, indeed, in ſo intereſted a view, but a conſideration of honour inſpired the ſame thoughts into them. The Princeſs <hi>Iſabella</hi> the eldeſt of the Infanta's of <hi>Spain</hi> was married very young to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Infanto of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> She was not full Eighteen years of age when ſhe was left a Widow; but that hindered not the <hi>Flemings</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from looking upon it as a thing undecent that the Archduke <hi>Philip,</hi> who was to be their Sovereign, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the leavings of the Infanto of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Beſides, they knew that the Infanto's Grandfather by the Father's ſide was a Baſtard, the Son of a Jewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine; and ſeeing the People of the Lower <hi>Germany</hi> conſpired with thoſe of the Upper not to ſuffer their Princes to Allie into Families, and with Perſons that had the leaſt blemiſh; though <hi>Maximilian</hi> would have deſired the eldeſt Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> for his Son, his own and his Sons Subjects would have univerſally oppoſed it. Nor would the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> have willingly ſuffered that he ſhould have brought into the Empire the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious example of baſe Alliances. And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53255:81"/> 
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> would have cut out work for himſelf that he could not be able to make an end of. So the Propoſition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King was without difficulty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the two Marriages were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. There was nothing particular in the Contracts that were made of them, except that <hi>Chievres</hi> had the care of ſeeing them drawn, and the Portion as well as the Dowry of the two Spouſes was very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. The King of <hi>France, Charles</hi> the Eighth, complained in vain of the infraction of his Treaty <note n="*" place="margin">In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi>
               </note> with <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> and the anſwer which the Spaniſh Embaſſadour <hi>Ayala</hi> made him thereupon ſeemed to add Railery to the Injury. He maintained that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Catholick King was free to diſpoſe of his Son and Daughter; and that the Treaty mentioned could not tie his hands, becauſe it was contrary to good manners as well as the Law of Nations; and ſeeing it would not be taken ill in <hi>Spain</hi> that the moſt Chriſtian King ſhould diſpenſe with ſuch an Obligation if it had been put upon him, no more ought his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty think it ſtrange that the Catholick King did the like.</p>
            <p>Both Marriages were compleated much about the ſame time, but they were not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53255:81"/> alike happy neither in their beginning, nor in their conſequences. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Life of <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh, that by the laſt Treaty of that Prince with <hi>Maximilian,</hi> it was ſtipulated that the Archdutcheſs <hi>Margarite</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe was out of the Cradle ſhould marry the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> who was <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth: That ſhe ſhould bring him in Portion the Counties of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Artois;</hi> and laſtly, that it ſhould not be in the power neither of the Father of the Princeſs, nor of the <hi>Flemings</hi> to break their Marriage before ſhe was of age to conſummate it, and that ſhe ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the ſigning of the Treaty be delivered into the hands of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>France,</hi> who ſhould carry her to the Court of the moſt Chriſtian King, to be brought up with the Dauphin till both were in a condition to live together. The Treaty was fully and faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and there are ſome Memoires which mention, that not only the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutcheſs was brought up with the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, but that beſides, the Ceremonies of their Marriage had been ſolemnized, and that there was nothing wanting but the conſummation when it was broken off by this accident.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53255:82"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Father to the Princeſs, in ſecond marriage eſpouſed the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne</hi> by Proxy; and thereby rendered himſelf ſo much the more formidable to the <hi>French,</hi> that his firſt marriage with the Heireſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had brought the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Provinces of the Low Countries and the <hi>Franche-County</hi> into his Family. They found no other remedy than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth to prevent him by marrying the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and the Archdutcheſs was ſent home to her Father, who married her, as hath been already ſaid, with the Infanto of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Ceremonies of the Marriage were performed at <hi>Ghent</hi> in <hi>February</hi> One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred and ninety ſeven, and the Princeſs embarked immediately after at <hi>Fluſhing</hi> on board the Admiral of the Fleet appointed to convoy her to <hi>Spain:</hi> but ſhe was no ſooner out at Sea, but that ſhe had reaſon to prognoſticate that her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage was not like to be more fortunate than the Firſt. She was toſſed in a violent ſtorm, which ſtill encreaſing ſurpaſſed the skill of the Seamen, and the experience of the Pilots; all were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they could not avoid being caſt away, and intimated no leſs to the Paſſengers as much by their frighted and ghaſtly looks, as by their diſcourſe. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53255:82"/> Archdutcheſs alone ſeemed unconcerned at the diſmal news, and feared ſo much the leſs to loſe her life as ſhe had greater intereſt than the reſt to preſerve it. Nay, in ſo ſad a Juncture ſhe was capable of a gay thought which ſeemed not ſuitable to an imagination that ought to have been ſcared with frightful apprehenſions. She made a pleaſant reflection upon the odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her adventures, ſuppoſing that the like had never hapned in the world, and their ſingularity in her opinion deſerved it ſhould be acquainted with them. She thought that never any woman was twice married and yet died a Virgin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to inform Poſterity of it ſhe took the following courſe. She had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to make her own Epitaph, and in two Verſes to expreſs therein what was moſt remarkable in her Life. She had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a great diſpoſition to Poetry, and ſo compoſed a Diſtich upon the ſpot. Manuſcripts relate the words variouſly, though they agree in the ſenſe, and it will not be amiſs to tranſcribe them here as they have been found. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Manuſcripts thus have hem,

               </q> It was not enough for the Archdutcheſs to have compoſed her own Epitaph, if ſhe hindered not the Waters, wherein ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to periſh, from ſpoyling the Paper on which it was written, and therefore ſhe wrap'd it up in Cerecloath. Beſides, it behoved her to oblige thoſe on the ſhoar, who might find her body and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph where the Sea caſt them out, to give a burial to the one, and cauſe the other to be engraven, and therefore ſhe took out of the Box where her Jewels were the richeſt Diamond ſhe had, and wrap'd it up in the Paper. After all, care muſt be taken that that Paper ſhould not be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from her Body, and therefore the Archdutcheſs tied the Cerecloath wherein the Diamond and Verſes were faſt about her Arm. In that poſture, without fear or changing her countenance, ſhe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53255:83"/> expected when the Ship ſhould ſink to the bottom; but her laſt hour was not as yet come; and the Ship that carried her, after it had been long beaten and toſſed by the Winds and Sea, run a ſhoar upon the Coaſt of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Galicia.</hi> From thence ſhe went by Land to <hi>Burgos,</hi> where the Catholick Kings then had their reſidence. Her marriage with the Infanto of <hi>Spain</hi> was there celebrated; and her big belly, which ſome time after began to appear, renewed the joy of the Court: but it continued but five or ſix months, for the Infanto fell ſick in the City of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca</hi> of a diſtemper whereof he died the four and twentieth of <hi>October</hi> the ſame year One thouſand four hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven.</p>
            <p>The beginning and progreſs of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper was diſcreetly concealed from his Wife, but the ſame circumſpection was not uſed at laſt. Inſtead of diſpoſing her by degrees to receive ſo ſtrange news, and gradually acquainting her with the loſs of her young Husband, they told her plainly and point blanck that ſhe was a Widow. It is not exactly known who it was that was ſo imprudent as unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to tell her the news, becauſe ſhe would never diſcover it, leſt the party might have been too ſeverely puniſhed.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53255:84"/> But it is certain, that the unhappineſs of her ſecond Widowhood brought into her mind <note n="*" place="margin">In the Latine Panegyrick of that Princeſs.</note> the injury ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth rejected her, and that the double grief ſhe felt was ſo violent, that ſhe was brought to bed before her time of a dead Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick King ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the loſs of an only Son, come to the age of ninteen years, three months, and ſix days, with a conſtancy of mind, which gave occaſion to thoſe who loved him not to ſuſpect him of inſenſibility. He was convinced by long experience that his Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> had a mind as great as his own; and yet he thought ſhe could not without falling down dead hear of the death of their Son, if the ſame fault were committed in acquainting her with it, that had cauſed the untimely Labour of their Daughter-in-law, and therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it by a way that ſucceeded. He had no other Philoſophy but what he had from Nature, and the violent grief wherewith he was then afflicted was the firſt of that kind that ever he had had: Nevertheleſs he thought that though the Catholick Queen were told but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and little and little of the death of the Infanto, all the Lenitives that could
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53255:84"/> be uſed in that caſe, would not hinder the tenderneſs of a Mother ſo deeply wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo ſurpriſing an accident from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in the body where it lodged an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal revolution, which putting the ſoul out of condition of exerting its chief functions there, would force it to be gone, and forſake its habitation. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Catholick King conſidered that if the ſame Soul could receive two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive paſſions that might ſucceed one another in a very ſhort time, it could not admit of a third, becauſe the impreſſion that they muſt have made upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the extreme violence that the ſame body muſt have been put to in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of them, would have exhauſted ſo many ſpirits, that there could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main enough for a freſh application of ſo large an extent. In a word, that Prince made a farther reflection, that if the functions of the Soul were weakened in three violent exerciſes of the ſame force, they would be much more weakened, when theſe exerciſes were not only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but alſo contrary, becauſe then the diſtance would be greater, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles more difficult to be ſurmounted. From theſe three Principles <hi>Ferdinand</hi> concluded, that to prevent Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> from expiring upon the news of her Sons
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53255:85"/> death, ſhe muſt firſt be put into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme grief upon a falſe ground: that then ſhe muſt be carried from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſadneſs to that of joy by ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſight what ſhe bewailed as loſt, and giving her by that means the ſpeedieſt and moſt agreeable conſolation that ſhe could be capable of: that laſtly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was deareſt to her, next to her Son, ſhould come and tell her that God had removed him, and ſhould ſweeten the bitterneſs of the tidings, by ſo many reaſons and examples, that the grief occaſioned thereby might produce no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects.</p>
            <p>So the Catholick King, having taken ſuch juſt meaſures that his Wife could not be informed of the death of her Son but from him, cauſed ſome perſons of credit to go and tell her that the King her Husband was dead of a ſudden death. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it the more eaſily that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſymptoms of thoſe that are ſubject to that kind of death. She was as deeply afflicted as ſhe ought to be, and in that condition ſhe was let alone about an hour. Her firſt tranſports of ſorrow were hardly over, when <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whom ſhe expected to ſee no more, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in her ſight. She was thereupon ſo raviſhed with joy, that ſhe could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53255:85"/> neither think of complaining of the trick that was put upon her, nor of quarrelling thoſe that had impoſed it. Her Husband let her alone in this fit of Joy almoſt as long as ſhe had been in grief, and then with very elaborate mollifying expreſſions told her that their Son was gone. She was indeed moved at it, but not ſo much as if it had been done in another manner, and ſome days after ſhe found her mind ſo much at eaſe again as to apply her ſelf to Affairs of State.</p>
            <p>The moſt important Affair was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Succeſſions of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> from devolving upon a foreign Family and not a <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> and ſeeing their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſties could not compaſs this deſign after the death of their only Son but by marrying again their eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Portugal,</hi> they intimated to <hi>Manuel,</hi> who had newly mounted the Throne of that Kingdom, that if he ſought her in marriage, he ſhould have her. <hi>Manuel</hi> was too ambitious to refuſe the Match that was offered him; and ſeeing at that time he had a deſign of conquering the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that he foreſaw the advantage that the Alliance of the Catholick Kings would afford him in the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the ſole proſpect of haſtening his Marriage, he neglected the uſual Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53255:86"/> in the Alliances of Kings. He demanded no ſecurity for his going into <hi>Caſtile;</hi> but appeared at the Court of the Catholick Kings ſooner than he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and there married the Infanta <hi>Iſabella</hi> to the extraordinary joy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> paſſionate for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Country, who thereby ſaw all their Monarchies, except that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> united into one. The new married Princes were acknowledged for Heirs apparent of <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Caramnel.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and preſumptive of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was ſo afraid leſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> into which his ſecond Daughter was married, might pretend any ſhare in the Succeſſion, that he obliged the Queen his Wife forthwith to aſſemble the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in the City of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> received the Oath of all the Deputies. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after he called the Eſtates of <hi>Arragon</hi> at <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> where the ſame Ceremony was performed. The joy of the People was redoubled by the Queen of <hi>Portugals</hi> being with Child, which appeared before they were diſmiſſed. The Catholick Kings were afraid that ſome inconvenience might befal her if ſhe accompanied the King her Husband who was upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and would not ſuffer
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53255:86"/> her to depart from <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> before ſhe was brought to bed. They choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtay there with her and divert her in expectation that ſhe ſhould give them an Heir; and in the mean time the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nations conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Antipathy that had continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them for ſo many Ages, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly ſpent their time at play, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Turnaments, and running at the Ring. The hopes that ſeemed almoſt certain of their being one day united contributed much to it; but there have been few of ſuch Feſtivals, wherein the concluſion anſwered the beginning. The Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> had had no Children by the Infanto <hi>Alphonſo</hi> her firſt Husband: She was already twenty eight years of age when ſhe was firſt with Child: Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians affirm, that on ſuch occaſions the pains of Labour encreaſe proportionably as the woman who is brought to bed the firſt time is advanced in age; and theſe three reaſons, with a fourth, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty obliges me to ſuppreſs, were the cauſe that her <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty could not be a Mother but at the coſt of her life. She was brought to bed in due time, and of a Son; but ſhe died of it, and all the hopes of the Catholick Kings were confined to their Grandſon, who was Chriſtened by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53255:87"/> the name of <hi>Michael.</hi> His Grandfather and Grandmother cauſed him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon;</hi> but he was ſo ſickly, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to look upon the Archdutcheſs of the Low Countries and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> her Husband as the Heirs apparent of their Monarchy. The Catholick Queen was ſo perſuaded of it when ſhe was informed that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutcheſs was on the four and twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> One thouſand five hundred, brought to bed of a Son, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> to whom <hi>Chievres</hi> was Governour, that by a ſpirit of Propheſie ſhe applied upon the ſpot theſe words of the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>The lot fell upon Matthias,</hi> alluding to the <hi>Saint</hi> whoſe Feaſt was that day celebrated in the Church, to ſignifie that the Child was born in ſo favourable a Juncture, that he would ſucceed to her Crowns as well as to thoſe of her Husband. The event ſoon followed the Prediction; and <hi>Charles</hi> was not as yet compleat five months old, when the Infanto <hi>Michael</hi> died the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>July</hi> the ſame year at the age of two years. The regrate of the Catholick Kings therefore was not equal, though on both ſides it was great, becauſe Queen <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> ſeeing an abſolute neceſſity that her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53255:87"/> muſt devolve upon a <hi>German</hi> Family, readily ſubmitted to the orders of Divine Providence, and with her own hand wrote to the Archdukes to haſten over to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> there to receive the Allegiance of the People as next and immediate Heirs, ſince ſhe was paſt the age of having any more Children.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was ſixteen years younger than his Queen, hoped to ſurvive her, marry again, and of a ſecond ventre have Male Iſſue that might exclude the Archdutcheſs from his Succeſſion. Upon that account he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as he could to deſire her to come into <hi>Spain,</hi> and did not do it till the laſt puſh, when his Wife told him that ſhe would of neceſſity ſee her eldeſt Daughter recognized by the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Union formed betwixt that Monarchy and the Monarchy of <hi>Arragon,</hi> required that the recognition ſhould be made in the Capital <note n="*" place="margin">Sarragoſſa.</note> City of <hi>Arragon</hi> immediately after it had been made in the Capital <note n="†" place="margin">Burgos.</note> of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, who for reaſons that ſhall be mentioned by and by, would not break it, at length conſented to what his Queen deſired.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53255:88"/>
            <p>The Archdukes paſſed through <hi>France,</hi> and arrived in <hi>Spain</hi> about the end of <hi>February</hi> One thouſand five hundred and two. They were extremely well received by the Catholick Queen, but the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ſo frank on the part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King. The pretext that Prince had to cloak his indifferency was, that the Archduke his Son-in-law brought, with him to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> a man that he did not like. That was the famous <hi>John Manuel,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſpeak at large in the ſequel of this Hiſtory. His birth was not illuſtrious; and he owed only to the ſharpneſs of his wit, and the extraordinary talent he had of writing well and faſt, the choice that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had made of him for his Secretary in thoſe diſpatches that required expedition. He had not ſerved long in that Station, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave proofs that he was capable of ſomething greater, and his Maſter ſent him Embaſſadour into <hi>Germany</hi> to the Court of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, where he concluded the double Alliance of the two Children of his Imperial Majeſty with the two Children of the Catholick Kings. He went afterward in the ſame Character to the <note n="*" place="margin">In the cauſes of the baniſhment of <hi>Manuel.</hi>
               </note> Low Countries, where he ſo dextrouſly managed the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53255:88"/> Archduke, that he became his Favourite. This ſucceſs put it in his mind to devote himſelf to that young Prince immediatly after the death of the Infanto <hi>Michael.</hi> He demanded leave to do ſo from Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Sovereign, who thought ſhe ought not to refuſe it him, becauſe it was more ways than one convenient for him to have a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> about him, ſince after her death he was to Reign in <hi>Caſtile.</hi> But <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> who at that time began to make a diſtinction betwixt his own Intereſts and thoſe of his Queen, liked not that a man who knew his ſecrets, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides was born a Subject of the Catholick Queens, ſhould have the entire confidence of the Heirs of that Princeſs, becauſe he foreſaw that the deſire of governing in his own Country as well as in <hi>Flanders,</hi> would encline him immediately after the death of <hi>Iſabella</hi> to perſuade the Archdukes, not to delay their taking poſſeſſion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> till the death of their Father-in-law. In that proſpect he omitted nothing that might oblige the Queen to recall <hi>Manuel</hi> from <hi>Flanders;</hi> but the Queen perſiſted in it that he ſhould continue there; and <hi>Manuel</hi> on his part neglected nothing that might render his abode neceſſary at the Court of the Archdukes. He behaved himſelf there to the full content of his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53255:89"/> Sovereign; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an averſion to him, which grew to that height that he could no longer diſſemble it. He made it appear upon ſeveral occaſions; and <hi>Manuel,</hi> who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the enmity of that Prince as a torrent of no long duration, that would not overſlow unleſs means were uſed to ſtem it, pretended not to take notice of the ſame. He made it only his buſineſs to inform the Archduke in thoſe thirteen months that he was in <hi>Spain</hi> of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> whom he might win over from his Father-in-law to himſelf, and to teach him the means how he might gain them.</p>
            <p>The Archduke had all that was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for improving the Councils of <hi>Manuel.</hi> He was the moſt affable Prince of his age, and was accuſtomed to carreſs all the <hi>Flemings</hi> almoſt equally of what condition ſoever they were, if they had the honour to approach him: However he never made himſelf ſo familiar as to render himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> and on no occaſion ſtooped ſo low as to loſe that gravity which they ſo much eſteem. He ſo tempered his civilities that they had all the ſucceſs which he expected, and that they who were honoured with them preferred his rule before that of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53255:89"/> And the truth is, he left <hi>Spain</hi> ſo generally beloved, that it was no more in the power of his Father-in-law to diſcredit him, though he might have had a mind to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſuffered him to ſtay there but as ſhort a while as he could; and though the Archdutcheſs was brought to bed in the City of <hi>Alcala</hi> of a ſecond Son, who was afterwards Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, they ſtayed not till ſhe was up again to give her Husband the ſatisfaction of returning in company with her. They would have him go before; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that was made uſe of for ſending him back with ſo much precipitation, was the Commiſſion he was charged with to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate at <hi>Blois</hi> where <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth was, an accommodation of the claſhing that had happened betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> about the dividing of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Archduke, as hath been ſaid in the former Book, treated like a Gentleman, and took all the care he ought in an Affair that nearly concerned him; ſince he was already aſſured to reap advantage from it.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as he ſet foot in <hi>France</hi> his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and he vied in genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The King ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> eight chief Lords of his Court, there to remain
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53255:90"/> as Hoſtages that no prejudice ſhould be done to the Archduke in his paſſage; and the Archduke, that he might teſtifie an entire confidence in the Kings word, wrote into <hi>Flanders</hi> that they ſhould ſend back the Hoſtages. The accommodation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Nations was concluded and ſigned; but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> diſowned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Son in-law, and thereby put an affront upon him, which in the Maximes of the World was too great and too publick to be pardoned. It was to no purpoſe for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to repreſent to the Archduke that it was he who would reap all the fruit of the perfidious action he complained of, and that thereby he would have the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> entire. The Archduke was nothing the leſs offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat; and <hi>Manuel</hi> finding him in that diſpoſition contributed not a little, as they ſay, to keep him in it, being aſſured to render himſelf neceſſary to his Maſter ſo long as it laſted.</p>
            <p>There was no more Commerce betwixt the Father and Son in law but what could not civilly be diſcontinued; and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke to make a cloſer Union with the moſt Chriſtian King againſt his Catholick Majeſty, made three agreements for the marriage of his eldeſt Son with <hi>Claude</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to his Majeſty:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53255:90"/> But the Alliances which are moſt ſecurely contracted in writing are not thoſe which moſt frequently ſucceed beſt. The death of Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> which happened the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of <hi>November</hi> One thouſand five hundred and four was the cauſe or pretext that the three Contracts of marriage were not fulfilled; and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> for all he was ſo politick a Prince, could not ward a blow that was ſo diſadvantageous to him, and ſo favourable to his Son-in-law. <note n="*" place="margin">In the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
               </note> There was indeed a Teſtament of Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> found which ordained that the King her Husband du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life ſhould have the adminiſtration and Revenues of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> but the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was no ſooner examined, than the Courtiers and Lawyers agreed in ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be forged. The Archduke who had a mind to reign, and ſaw himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for a long time, and perhaps for his whole life by an Act ſo inconſiſtent with Motherly affection, had no regard to it; and indeed it was hard to be believed that it could have been dictated and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> conſidering her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour all her life time in relation to her Husband, for there hapned to that Princeſs what is but too common to Women, who out of a Maxim of State marry Husbands
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53255:91"/> as young again as themſelves. When <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> were married, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> was but ſixteen years old, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> two and thirty. Her Jealouſie of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> appeared ſoon after their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and it ought to be ſaid here for her excuſe that it was not without ground; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſlighted her, and been often unfaithful, though ſhe was very beautiful, and beſides, no woman living more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in the point of Chaſtity than her ſelf. He had loved other Ladies, by whom he had the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa, Don Alphonſo d' Arragon,</hi> and other Baſtards, who will be more properly mentioned in another place of this Hiſtory. <hi>Iſabella</hi> had not therefore behaved her ſelf the worſe towards him: but Injuries of that nature which are moſt patiently born with, are not thoſe for all that which make the ſmalleſt impreſſions in peoples minds, and are ſooneſt blotted out. If <hi>Iſabella</hi> had ſo much command over her ſelf, as during her life to diſſemble the ramblings of her Husband, it is not very likely that at her death ſhe would reward him for them, that is to ſay, in a Juncture when there is no time for counterfeiting, and when ſhe was no longer to obſerve meaſures with him; nor that ſhe would have deprived her eldeſt Daughter of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53255:91"/> enjoyment of the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which Nature, Law, Reaſon, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>Spain</hi> gave to her, to leave it to a fickle Husband, who would not fail ſo ſoon as he ſhould be a Widower to marry again; nor to employ all ſorts of means not only to ſecure to the Children of the ſecond Marriage the Crowns of <hi>Arragon,</hi> but alſo, if poſſible, to procure for them the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in prejudice of the Children of his former bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> had cauſe to fear it, ſince the Father and Mother of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had done as much for him, and that the unfortunate <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Vienne,</hi> the Son of the firſt Wife of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> had been poyſoned to make way for the ſame <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> who was only the Son of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Be it as it will, the Archduke was not amuſed by the Couriers whom his Father in law ſent to ſtay him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> under pretext that it might be prejudicial to the Archdutcheſs his Wife, ready to lie in of a Daughter, which was <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary.</hi> He nevertheleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with her for <hi>Spain</hi> in the month of <hi>January</hi> One thouſand five hundred and ſeven, and the new Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had no prejudice by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> was left Governour of the Low Countries, and <hi>Manuel</hi> accompanied
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53255:92"/> the Archduke. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was ſo ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the courſe his Daughter and Son-in-law took, that he went to wait for them at one end of <hi>Spain</hi> whilſt they landed at the other. All the great men of the Kingdom, except two, declared for them: they were ſolemnly Crowned: the People ſwore Allegiance to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the Teſtament of the late Queen; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> finding himſelf not to be the ſtronger, cauſed an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to be propoſed to his Son-in-law, ſeeing he confided far more in his own management than in that of his Agents, he ſollicited with ſo much perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance an interview with the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that he obtained it: but it coſt him dear, and he muſt firſt paſs through mortifications that were ſo much the more ſenſible to him, as that he was the leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the like.</p>
            <p>He was conſtrained to go to his Son-in-law, truſt himſelf in his hands, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his bare word for a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and to preſent himſelf in the poſture of a Supplicant. He appeared, indeed, in that manner accompanied with a ſmall Retinue without Arms, and mounted on Mules. He could not have a private Conference with his Son-in-law; and <hi>Manuel,</hi> who was the man in the world
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53255:92"/> he hated moſt, becauſe he imputed to him all the harſhneſs he found in the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> towards him, made always a third perſon in the Conference. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at firſt loſt his hopes of retaining the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration left him by his Wife, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended at length to accept one half of the Revenues. But he was poſitively denied any ſhare, and ſent back extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed that he had humbled himſelf in vain.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who was no leſs his Friend though he owed not his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, mediated for him another interview with his Son-in law in the Veſtry of the Church of <hi>Remedo,</hi> a League from <hi>Vailladolid.</hi> The two Kings diſcourſed alone without any other Witneſs but the Cardinal who kept the door. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at length, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould abſolutely renounce the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile</hi> upon two conditions; The one, that he ſhould enjoy during life the three great <hi>Maſteries</hi> of the Orders of St. <hi>James, Callatrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara:</hi> The other, that his Son-in-law ſhould pay him yearly at <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> whither he ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the interview retire, a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Penſion, which amounted but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome, to three Counts of <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedis,</hi> or to eight Counts, at moſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53255:93"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was no ſooner in <hi>Arragon</hi> but that he laboured to be revenged for the pretended indignities received from his Son-in-law. He ſuppoſed that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal charms of that young Prince would indeed preſerve to him the affections of the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> in time of Peace: but he doubted that that inclination would not continue in time of War. Upon this he grounded his conjecture; that the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> as ſhall be mentioned hereafter, being exceſſively liberal, there was no appearance that he would moderate that predominant inclination in the midſt of Arms, and when every moment he would have freſh occaſions of giving. In the mean time the Revenue of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and of the Crowns that depended on it, were ſo ſcanty that they could not ſuffice to carry on a long War, and at the ſame time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſuperfluous expenſiveneſs of their King. His Majeſties Treaſury would thereby ſoon be drained; and if the ſeeds of a Civil War could be ſowed when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was wanting, a general revolution would quickly follow; and the ſame <hi>Philip,</hi> who till then had been the Idol of the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> would become their aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The meaſures to be taken for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that project ought not to be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53255:93"/> managed but by a very cunning perſon, and for that purpoſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> employed the famous <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Cardonna</hi> with the following inſtructions. <note n="*" place="margin">In his life in <hi>Caſtillian.</hi>
               </note> It hath been mentioned in the preceding Book that Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> at firſt reigned not peaceably in <hi>Caſtile:</hi> That her Brother <hi>Henry</hi> had by the Infanta of <hi>Portugal</hi> a Daughter, the moſt beautiful and unfortunate of her age: That <hi>Iſabella</hi> had maintained that <hi>Henry</hi> was impotent: That <hi>Bertrand de la Cueva,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was her Father; and that by conſequent ſhe ought not to ſucceed to the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The probability of that diſcourſe was grounded upon this, that <hi>Henry</hi> having no Children by the Infanta of <hi>Navarre</hi> his firſt Wife had divorced her; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been able to get none neither upon the ſecond, the report went, that he had rather that his Favourite <hi>La Cueva</hi> ſhould ſupply his defect, than that he ſhould be reckoned impotent. He conſtantly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Daughter whom his Wife brought forth for his own; and his Siſter <hi>Iſabella</hi> being too weak to make her paſs for illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, had her recourſe to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and married him though ſhe was thirty two years of age, and he but ſixteen, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that he would back her
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53255:94"/> intereſt with the Forces that he could bring from <hi>Arragon. Ferdinand</hi> in a pitch'd Battel routed thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Party of the Princeſs of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> forced her to take refuge in <hi>Portugal,</hi> obliged the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to declare her Baſtard, and maintained himſelf in the poſſeſſion of theſe Kingdoms during the life of <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after her death for his own ſake, he formed a deſign of repairing the wrong he had done, and propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the marriage of the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to bring her back by force of Arms into the Kingdoms that had belonged to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to raiſe her the Party there again which before he had ſuppreſſed, and there to renew the Civil War, in the opinion that as at that time when the Forces of <hi>Arragon</hi> in the diſpute betwixt the Aunt and the Neece were ſufficient to give the Monarchy to her of the two Pretendents they declared in favours of, that is, for the Aunt in prejudice of the Neece; ſo they would be ſtill ſufficient to turn the balance on the Neeces ſide in prejudice of the Children of the Aunt, when they ſhould awaken the dormant Faction, under the ſame pretext that had been before made uſe of, which was that of marriage.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53255:94"/>
            <p>There appeared only two impediments which might croſs his marriage to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted; for as to the third which was the averſion that the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> becauſe he had robbed her of her Dominions, he made account that ſhe would be reconciled to him ſo ſoon as he offered to re-eſtabliſh her in the Throne; and that ſhe would chuſe rather by marrying him to recover the faireſt Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> than as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon to ſpend the reſt of her days in a forced continence. The firſt Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the judgment of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would be on the part of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, an undertaking bold man, and ambitious to ſignalize himſelf, but ſcrupulous and reſerved in granting favours, upon the ſole account of making them the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It was to be feared that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would hardly be brought to conſent that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould marry the Neece of his deceaſed Wife, and that he would abſolutely refuſe the diſpenſation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, were it for nothing elſe but that he might not fall out with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which would thereby be irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilably offended. But the enmity that <hi>Julius</hi> entertained againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and the reſolution he had already taken by all means to engage <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to joyn with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53255:95"/> him for driving them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> made a ſtronger impreſſion in the mind of that Pope, than the Canon Laws. He gave intimation to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhould be no hindrance to the marriage that he had in his head; and ſo all <hi>Ferdinands</hi> care was to get over the next difficulty.</p>
            <p>It conſiſted in getting the Princeſs out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and by conſequent in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Manuel</hi> to deliver her. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> expected far leſs oppoſition to his deſigns on the part of that Prince, than he had found from the Pope, becauſe <hi>Manuel</hi> was doubly his Son-in-law. It hath been ſaid before that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> gave him in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age his eldeſt Daughter upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but that he might hinder his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from falling to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> into which the ſecond Daughter was married; and it is to be added here, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s caution proving ineffectual, he farther gave his third Daughter to his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty, who by conſequent, by an odd ſingularity not as yet to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled in theſe laſt Ages, having for his firſt Wife married his Nephew's Widow, for his ſecond married the Siſter of his former Wife<note n="*" place="margin">He married al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for his third Wife the Daughter of the Siſter of his two former Wives.</note>. But what appears to Kings moſt feiſible in ſpeculation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53255:95"/> is not ſo always in practice, becauſe ſelf-love ſometimes repreſents to them the intereſts that ſets them upon action more urgent than it ſeems to be to other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, who they think ought to ſecond them in the execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was of the humour of Princes who come to the Crown by chance, and without laying claim to it directly. He was only the kinſman far remote in a collateral Line of <hi>John</hi> the ſecond his Predeceſſour, and by conſequent he was afraid upon the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt occaſions to loſe the good fortune that had happened to him contrary to his expectation. He ſaw no advantage nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent nor future in the propoſition made to him of delivering the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and on the contrary found in it preſent inconveniences, and inevitable Wars afterwards. If the Princeſs had Children by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Manuel</hi> would be the farther removed from the Succeſſion of <hi>Arragon:</hi> if ſhe had none, and yet out-lived him, ſhe would transfer the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to him whom ſhe ſhould chuſe for a ſecond Husband; and if ſhe married not again, <hi>Manuel</hi> and his Iſſue who were not next of kin to her, would not inherit any thing of hers. In the mean time ſeeing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> only
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53255:96"/> demanded the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to hinder the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from ſettling in <hi>Spain;</hi> If <hi>Manuel</hi> granted her, he would raiſe a Civil War in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the ſucceſs whereof it was impoſſible for him to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee: If the Arms of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> prevailed there, his Majeſty of <hi>Portugal</hi> would not be the better for it, ſince his Father-in-law was neither liberal nor grateful: but if <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſuccumbed, <hi>Portugal</hi> would immediately after have upon its back, beſides the Forces of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countries, which he would be the leſs able to reſiſt that there was no communication betwixt the Kingdoms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> to receive Succours from thence. So that the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was fairly <note n="*" place="margin">In the Manual of <hi>Oſorio.</hi>
               </note> denied to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who not being able to carry her, deſpaired of having her for Wife. At the ſame time he loſt all hopes of getting the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but deſpaired not of excluding it from his own Succeſſion; and that he might compaſs that, he choſe rather to court the Neece of his greateſt Enemy than to remain a Widower.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de Foix,</hi> Vicecount of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> married <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53255:96"/> whom he had two Children, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> who was afterward killed at the Battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and <hi>Germana de Foix,</hi> whom the moſt Chriſtian King cauſed to be brought up with his Daughters. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> pitched upon her for his ſecond Wife; and ſeeing he commonly propoſed to himſelf more than one end in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he had two in this, as you ſhall ſee: The firſt was, that <hi>Germana</hi> might one day furniſh him with a plauſible pretext of uſurping <hi>Navarre,</hi> in that the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> the Father of that Princeſs, was concerned in that famous caſe of conſcience upon which Theology had always been conſulted, though the determinations thereof were never acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced unto, but always decided by the Sword. This is not a proper place of giving inſtances of it, and the buſineſs here is only to lay down plainly the matter of fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> Prince of <hi>Bearn,</hi> had a Son already of his own name, <hi>Gaſton</hi> by <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> his Wife, at that time when ſhe ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>Navarre,</hi> by the death of <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Vienne</hi> her only Brother, and of <hi>Iſabella</hi> her eldeſt Siſter without Children. <hi>Leonora</hi> being ſettled in the Succeſſion of <hi>Navarre</hi> was brought to bed of a ſecond Son, who was <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53255:97"/> Viſcount of <hi>Narbonne. John</hi> pretended to the Crown of <hi>Navarre</hi> in excluſion of his elder Brother as being the Son of a Queen and a King, whereas his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was but the Son of a Count and Counteſs. The difference could not be ſifted to the bottom, becauſe the elder Brother having married <hi>Magdalen</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, was put into poſſeſſion of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and left it to his Children. The Viſcount left alſo his Pretenſions to <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> his Son, and to <hi>Germana</hi> his Daughter, <hi>Gaſton</hi> was of ſo warlike a temper, that it was eaſie to be foreſeen that he would be ſlain; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> looked upon <hi>Germana</hi> as a preſumptive Heireſs that might bring him a Title to the Crown of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which he well knew how to make the beſt of in time and place convenient.</p>
            <p>The ſecond end that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelf in his marriage with <hi>Germana,</hi> was to ſtrike in with <hi>France</hi> in a Juncture when poſſeſſing no longer the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he was not now ſtrong enough to return what he had uſurped upon <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth in <hi>Italy.</hi> In the three views then that we have been mentioning, he cauſed an offer to be made to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty of treating with him upon two conditions: the one,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53255:97"/> that he would give him in Marriage <hi>Germana</hi> his Neece; the next, that if Male Children ſprung from that Marriage, that might live to be in a condition one day to Reign, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould belong to them with the conſent of <hi>France,</hi> which in that caſe ſhould yield to them all the claim it had to it: but if the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were barren, or at leaſt as to Male Children capable of reigning, that then the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould return to the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> in excluſion of the Daughters of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and of their Poſterity. <hi>Louis</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> becauſe he only conſidered it on the ſide it was advantageous to him. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had been unfortunate in the Wars of <hi>Naples:</hi> he had loſt three great Armies there: his Treaſures were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the prodigious charges he had been at; and his moſt courteous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hindered him from oppreſſing the People, as muſt needs have been done to continue that War. The occaſion that preſented for recovering the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was favourable. He had the greater reaſon to embrace it, that it would not coſt him one drop of bloud; and though it was not altogether certain that it would ſucceed, yet there was but little
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53255:98"/> wanting to make it infallible. The truth was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was not old, but his former incontinence had ſo weakened him that his Phyſicians durſt not hope for any more Children from him. He had entertained frequent and long correſpondences with the Counteſs of <hi>Eboly,</hi> by whom he had had the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo d' Arragon,</hi> and a Daughter marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Bernardin de Valeſco</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> with the Lady <hi>Tole de Bibao,</hi> by whom he had had a Daughter that was a Nun in the Monaſtery of <hi>Madrigal:</hi> and with a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Lady of the Houſe of <hi>Perreira,</hi> by whom he had another Daughter that was a Nun as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.<note n="*" place="margin">In the Book of <hi>Mayerne.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>It was to be preſumed that that amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination, ſeconded by the plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigour of <hi>Germana,</hi> would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend <hi>Ferdinand</hi> into the other world, and that by conſequent <hi>France</hi> would not long expect to enter again into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples.</hi> In fine, the intereſts of <hi>Arragon</hi> were for ever, or at leaſt for ſome time, divided from thoſe of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and <hi>France</hi> found its advantage in both theſe Junctures, though it would have found it far more in the firſt than in the ſecond.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:53255:98"/>
            <p>The Marriage of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana</hi> was no ſooner conſummated, but that Prince made a project of ſecuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely in the poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> upon pretext of being in a better condition of fulfilling the Treaty which he had concluded with <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth. That Crown had been partly conquered, and partly uſurped by the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> which gave them occaſion to pretend that it was annexed to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and not to that of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The great Captain <hi>Gonſalvo de Cordova</hi> had not expelled King <hi>Frederick</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> from thence; and ſeeing he was born a Subject of the late Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and that it was ſhe that had given him the command of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army which he had conducted with ſo much ſucceſs, it was to be thought that he would have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> for the Heireſs of that Princeſs, as ſixteen years before he would have had the Kingdom of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> which he had conquered, united to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Infidels having been chiefly ſubdued by the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Forces. If any thing could hinder him from doing it, it muſt be the preſence of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and that Prince upon that very account alone did not ſtand deliberating if he ſhould go to <hi>Naples.</hi> He departed from <hi>Barcelona</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53255:99"/> with his new Queen, and his Voyage was more proſperous than he expected. He found not in <hi>Italy</hi> the reſiſtance which he expected; and the <hi>Great Captain</hi> inſtead of fortifying himſelf in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who carried not along with him Forces enough to drive him out of it, preferred the Grandeur of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> before his own intereſts, merely upon the conſideration that he had enlarged it by the acceſſion of two Crowns. He foreſaw that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would have no more Children; and that his Grandſon <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſucceeding to him, would become the moſt powerful Monarch of <hi>Europe.</hi> He alſo foreſaw that if he reſiſted <hi>Ferdinand, Spain</hi> would loſe the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> becauſe the obſtinate humour of that Prince would make him rather abandon it to <hi>France</hi> than leave it in the power of a revolted Subject.</p>
            <p>Upon two ſuch Metaphyſical Principles the <hi>Great Captain</hi> of his own accord laid down the Vice-royalty of <hi>Naples.</hi> He ſtayed not till <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould conſtrain him, but reduced himſelf to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a private man: He came out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> where he could do any thing; went as far as <hi>Genoa</hi> to meet the Catholick King, received him at the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53255:99"/> Harbour of that City, and wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to his diſcretion. That unexpected adventure was not the paſſage of the Reign of <hi>Frederick</hi> that moſt affected him; he had two others which ſupervened ſo pat, that he could not have drawn greater advantage from them, though he had been the Author of the ſame. The one was the death of the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi>
               </note> his Son-in-law, and the other the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Queen of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi>
               </note> his Daughter. The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> remaining peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of that Monarchy by his Father-in-laws retiring into <hi>Arragon,</hi> minded nothing but his diverſions, and lived in too great a freedom with his principal Subjects, not to give them occaſion of abuſing it. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Burgos,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>old Caſtile,</hi> was fallen void, and the King gave it to his Favourite <hi>Manuel. Manuel</hi> had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of it, but he invited his Maſter to a magnificent Feaſt. It is not known whether the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> eat and drank more than was fit: whether any of his Enemies or <hi>Manuel</hi> found a way to convey Poyſon into the choiceſt dainties of the entertainment: or whether the great exerciſe which the King uſed immediately after ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53255:100"/> a Dinner without giving his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach time to concoct, ruined the health of that young Prince, which from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy had never ſuffered any alteration: but it is certain that he played long at Tennis after he roſe from Table; and that the ſame Evening, which was the nineteenth of <hi>September</hi> One thouſand five hundred and ſix, he was taken ill of a Fever. Seeing there appeared a Comet at that time; and that the great men as well as the common people are perſuaded that ſuch Stars are not only the ſigns, but alſo the cauſes of the death of Sovereigns; it made ſo deep an impreſſion upon the imagination of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that during his ſickneſs, which laſted but ſeven days, he complained at every moment of the Comet. Nor did he loſe the fancy of it in the height of a hot fit that ſeized him two days before he expired; and and when he became light-headed, he cried out in <hi>French</hi> even to his laſt gaſp with a lamentable tone, <hi>Ah Comet, ah Comet.</hi> He died the five and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> One thouſand five hundred and ſix, at the age of twenty eight years, when he had only reigned two years; and though he was a <hi>German</hi> by extraction, and a <hi>Fleming</hi> by birth, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a natural averſion to a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53255:100"/> Foreign Dominion, yet they never la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the death of any of their Kings ſo bitterly as they did his. The ſhortneſs of his Reign was probably the cauſe of it; and there is ground to think by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if he had lived longer, he had neither been ſo much, nor ſo univerſally regretted. He gave by handfuls, and without diſtinction of perſons. In the diſtribution of his favours he had not ſo much regard to merit and ſervices, as to the diligence of thoſe who firſt preſented him their <note n="*" place="margin">In his Elogy.</note> Petitions; and it is reported of him, that his Council having one day asked him if he had granted the gift that they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him, he made anſwer, that he did not remember; but that they might eaſily know it of him who they thought had received it, if he had asked the ſame, ſeeing in that caſe he was ſure he had granted it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jane</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> loved him with too great a tenderneſs to be free from Jealouſie. She underſtood whilſt ſhe was in <hi>Flanders</hi> that he loved and was beloved of a Lady of <hi>Brabant.</hi> That was enough to ſet her upon a revenge, which was the firſt ſign ſhe gave of a diſtraction of mind. She went to the place where her Rival was, and called her before her: She ordered
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53255:101"/> two or three of her Servants to ſecure her hand and foot: She fell upon her; cut off her lovely head of hair, and with her Sciſſors ſo disfigured the lovely traits of her face, that the moſt charming beauty of the Low Countries durſt not ſhew her ſelf any more abroad. The Archduke was extremely vexed at it: but he was conſtrained to diſſemble his diſpleaſure when he perceived that the more he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided her with it, the more enraged and furious ſhe grew. He carefully after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward avoided the giving her the leaſt occaſion of Jealouſie. By her he had two Sons, who were both Emperours, and three Daughters, who were the Queens of <hi>Hungary, France,</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> he left her with Child of a third, who was alſo Queen of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and whether her grief for his death overcame her reaſon, or that it only ſtirred up in her the diſpoſitions to madneſs which were tranſmitted to her with the bloud of her maternal Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> it is but too true that ſhe loſt her Judgment in ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a manner, that ſhe never recovered a moments uſe of it during the whole fifty years that ſhe lived after. We leave it to Philoſophers and Phyſicians to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how the mad <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> could communicate to <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53255:101"/> her Grand-daughter the diſtemper of mind wherewith ſhe had been afflicted, without any blemiſh to the Conduit that conveyed it; and by what frekiſhneſs of nature it happened that <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> in the time of her greateſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, was brought to bed of <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> one of the wiſeſt Queens that ever was: that amongſt the Daughters of <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the ſecond only was ſubject to the diſtemper of her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and that that diſtemper ſtopt ſo preciſely at that ſecond Daughter, that neither the two Sons and ſour Daughters which ſhe left, nor the numerous Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſince deſcended from them have ſhewn the leaſt ſign of it, unleſs it be her great Grandſon the Prince <hi>Don Carlos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall only obſerve here, that the Queen, Widow of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> religiouſly kept the body of her Husband ſo long as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hindred her not from kiſſing it, and with much ado ſhe ſuffered it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be imbalmed, and to be put into a Leaden Coffin: but inſtead of ſending it into the Church appointed for his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, ſhe kept it by her, and carried it about a long time all over <hi>Spain,</hi> as if her Frenzy had moved her to verifie one of the oddeſt Propheſies that ever was. It hath been already ſaid, that the King her
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53255:102"/> Husband was one of the handſomeſt men of his Age; and it is very well known, that Princes, in whom that perfection ſets off the luſtre of their virtues, delight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to ſhew themſelves. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Anſtria</hi> was no ſooner peaceable King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by the accommodation that he made with his Father-in-law, which we mentioned before, that he went to ſee all the Towns and places any way conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of his new Dominion. He joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received the acclamations of the People; but an old woman, having ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly beheld him, thought it not enough, as the reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> women, to bloſs the Womb of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> that had born him, but ſhe farther added, that it was to no purpoſe for him to travel over <hi>Caſtile</hi> in his life time; for that he ſhould travel it much more and longer after his death. Which was punctually fulfilled. No leſs extraordinary was the garb that the poor Queen put her ſelf into for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting from City to City, and from Town to Town her Husbands body. She was cloathed in plain ordinary Mourning; her head muffled up in a kind of Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins hood; her Sleeves covering her hands; and a black Veil much like to that of Nuns, ſave only that it was much thicker, hindered her no leſs from ſeeing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53255:102"/> than from being ſeen. She continued to wander up and down <hi>Spain</hi> till the King her Son ſhut her up in the Caſtle of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defillas</hi> under the care of the wiſe <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> of <hi>Valanca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tordefillas</hi> was a pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place, and beſides nothing was omitted that might ſerve to diſpel the melancholy of the Queen: Nevertheleſs ſhe perſiſted obſtinately in leading the moſt pitiful and wretched life that can be found in the Hiſtories of Princeſſes of theſe latter Ages. She choſe the leaſt, darkeſt, loweſt, and moſt incommodious Chamber of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, there to abide day and night. There ſhe lay upon the ground; and it was after much importunity that ſhe ſuffered them to lay a board under her covered with a Carpet. She never warmed her ſelf by a fire in Winter: and would not be thicker cloathed in the coldeſt weather than ſhe was in Summer. She continued frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three days and three nights without eating or drinking; and when they ſpake to her of taking any diverſion, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant anſwer was, that it was unſeemly for a Widow, and upon that account alone would not. She charged them not to bring her her Victuals but in Earthen diſhes; and when a great many diſhes of that ſort full of meat were brought to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53255:103"/> her, ſhe would not ſuffer them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away before ſhe had touched them. Nor could ſhe endure either to be made clean, or to have her Chamber kept neat. So that the meat corrupted there, and ſent out a ſmell that none but her ſelf could endure. She had no intervals in her diſtemper but when her Father the Catholick King was with her. The truth is, in his preſence, and ſo long as he was there, ſhe committed no irregularity: but in exchange the notion that ſhe retained of the reſpect ſhe ought to have for him to whom ſhe owed her being was ſo ſtrong, that being neither corrected nor modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reaſon, it degenerated into a kind of inſenſibility that rendred her immovable like a Statue, and took from her the uſe of her tongue. At other times ſhe was mightily prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of the injuſtice that was done her in detaining her Priſoner; and the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong conceit ſhe had of Grandeur, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her not to forget that ſhe was Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by her own right. When ſhe was in her ſenſes, and during the life of her Husband, ſhe had ſuffered him to Reign, nay, and to Reign alone, and ſhe took no exceptions at all that he gave her no ſhare in the Government: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe became exceſſively jealous of her
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53255:103"/> Authority when ſhe was no more in a condition of exerting it. Night and day ſhe made her complaints to Heaven and Earth of the inhumanity of thoſe who confined her to <hi>Tordeſillas.</hi> She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her ſelf with her Mother, and thought at leaſt that ſhe had as much prudence as ſhe had for governing. She knew that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Father had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore attempted to take upon himſelf alone the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> That Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> had oppoſed it: That ſhe had demanded Juſtice from the States, and that by them ſhe had been ſolemnly maintained in the poſſeſſion of her right; from whence Queen <hi>Jane</hi> concluded, that ſince ſhe was no leſs Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> than her Mother had been, ſhe ought upon ſtronger grounds to exert the Functions of Government by reaſon of her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ſo true it is that though the deſire of independence be the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that takes poſſeſſion of the heart of man, yet it is not the laſt that abandons it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> ſo ſoon deprived of their new King, and diſcouraged by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of their Queen, were forced to have their recourſe to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> There were ſome amongſt them who made ſome difficulty of reſolving upon that: but it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53255:104"/> ceaſed when they who knew <hi>Ferdinand</hi> beſt, told them that the joy which that Prince would conceive in recovering the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile</hi> would be ſo great, and that the need he ſtood in of the Forces of that Monarchy for ſecuring his Dominion in <hi>Naples</hi> was ſo urgent, that though he might reſent moſt deeply the ſleight put upon him by the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> in preferring his Son-in-law before him, yet not only he would ſhew no outward marks thereof, but would alſo for the future more cautiouſly manage that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For then he would be apprehenſive through his own experience that as they had once already ſhaken off his yoke when they found it too heavy, ſo they might again ſhake it off with ſo much the more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, the Father of their late King, deſired no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to be called in to ſupply the place of his Son during the minority of his Grandchild.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> more fortunate than he expected, was invited to retake the Government of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which two and twenty months before had been ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly taken from him, and did not loſe ſo favourable an occaſion. The conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that had been made of his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved to be exactly true, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53255:104"/> that politick Prince was ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging himſelf on thoſe who had thruſt him out, that he made it his particular care to gain them; and the firſt places that fell void, as well as the favours that came to be diſtributed, were all for them.</p>
            <p>So rare and judicious a procedure had the effect that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> expected from it. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> being perſuaded that he generouſly pardoned becauſe he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſeem unmindful of their fault, on their part remembred it no more neither but only to make amends for it, and lived afterward in ſo exact a ſubmiſſion, that during the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> they forbore to demand, as it was their cuſtom to do, the Convocation of the Eſtates for regulating the Government of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and if thereafter they were aſſembled, it was at his deſire. None but <hi>Manuel,</hi> who being more politick, and by conſequent more diſtruſtful than the reſt, was of a contrary opinion to that of the publick, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſt <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> He thought that he had too highly offended him to refer himſelf abſolutely to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eretion without paſſing for an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man; and the inſtance of the <hi>Great Captain</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gonſalvo.</note>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:53255:105"/> whom his Friends propoſed to him as a ſignal proof of the clemency of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, wrought nothing at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. He choſe rather to baniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Caſtile</hi> than to live under an offended Maſter, and quitted the great preferments that he owed to the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that he might go live without employment in <hi>Flanders</hi> with the Archduke <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres,</hi> who intended to make uſe of him for the execution of the deſigns that ſhall be related in the ſequel of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, received him as the ſervices which he had rendered to their common Maſter deſerved, and made him his intimate friend. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was the more incenſed at the retreat of <hi>Manuel,</hi> becauſe he knew him to be a man capable of forming and keeping on foot, dangerous intrigues againſt him in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> though he was in the Low Countries, and uſed all means to hinder him from doing ſo. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Catholick Majeſty thought it not fit to perſecute him directly, leſt the other <hi>Caſtilians</hi> might take umbrage thereat, but thought it enough to attack him by ſuch ways as concealed private revenge under a cloak of publick good. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deprived him of what he had purchaſed in <hi>Spain;</hi> and endeavoured as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53255:105"/> much as in him lay to reduce him to his firſt ſtate. The pretext which he took to impoveriſh him without ſtartling the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillians</hi> deſerves to be known. The profuſeneſs of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> had been ſo great that it had encroached upon the Crown-Rents of the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which till then had never been alienated. <note place="margin">In the revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> took the occaſion he ſought for to revoke all the Grants made by that young Prince for what cauſe ſoever; and reſerved to himſelf the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming thoſe which ſhould appear to him to be juſt. The <hi>Caſtillians</hi> took no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at that order, becauſe it excuſed them from ſupplying the ordinary charges of the State, and <hi>Manuel</hi> thereby loſt the great ſettlements that he had in <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He thought it not convenient to make any attempt for retaining them; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he foreſaw it would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he would not give <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of refuſing him, He ſuffered himſelf to be ſtript of all without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; and revenged himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards according to the manner of the moſt refined Politicians, that is to ſay, by the help, and under the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:53255:106"/>
            <p>He ſeconded <hi>Chievres</hi> in his deſign of thruſting <hi>Ferdinand</hi> once more out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> by oppoſing the Emperour <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Firſt to him; and the meaſures that were taken to bring that about were ſo juſt, that had it not been for <hi>France</hi> they had ſucceeded. The Emperour rejected no propoſition that gave him occaſion of getting much money with little pains, and upon that weak ſide <hi>Chievres</hi> and <hi>Manuel</hi> attacked him. They cauſed it to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him by men that ſeemed zealous for his Intereſts, that the Catholick King had doubly offended him, firſt in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him ſo great an affront, that no ordinary Gentleman would ſit down with without venturing his life to have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for it; next in doing him a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piece of injuſtice, equally contrary to the right of private men, and to that of Sovereigns. The affront conſiſted in this, that the Catholick King ſtruck at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours reputation in ſuppoſing him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the guardianſhip of the Children of the late King of <hi>Caſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> his Son, ſeeing he had taken from him the adminiſtration of the beſt part of their Inheritance which was the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> that the injuſtice regarded the excluſion of the noble Sex, and the ſubſtitution of the more ignoble in the moſt important of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53255:106"/> civil actions, which was the Regency of States: That all the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Europe</hi> called the Fathers of young So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns to that Regency, even when their Sovereignties came by the Mother; and that if there were no Father, the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father for the ſame reaſon was preferred before the Grandmother, and the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grandfather before the Maternal. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Catholick King was gone into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> had received the Oath of the People, had put himſelf into poſſeſſion of the Guardianſhip of the Children, and converted their Revenues to his own uſe: That the People of the Low Countries had ſo univerſally acknowledged that they could not lawfully fruſtrate the Emperour of the Guardianſhip of his Grand-children, that the ſeventeen Provinces had by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent referred it to him; and that if the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> had not imitated them, the blame muſt be caſt upon the cunning of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> who had over-reached them: That there was no more needful to force him once more out of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to them that they were outwitted by him; and that if notwithſtanding they perſiſted to own him as Regent, it was eaſie for his Imperial Majeſty to bring him to reaſon, by ſending <hi>German</hi> Forces into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> by the Gulph of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53255:107"/>
            <p>The Emperour was ſo much the more ſenſibly moved with this diſcourſe, that it opened him a way of enjoying almoſt the whole revenues of his Grandſons, the eldeſt being maintained by the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and the younger needing only a ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for maintaining him in the Colledge of <hi>Alcala</hi> where he was. His Imperial Majeſty ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to bid him leave the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and to declare War againſt him if he failed to do it within a time limited. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> knew <hi>Maximilian</hi> too well to be afraid of him ſo long as none but he made War againſt him, becauſe he was ſure that in that caſe his Imperial Majeſty would do it but weakly, and but for a ſhort time too: But he apprehended that when the <hi>French</hi> ſaw him once engaged in the Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and reduced to an inability of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his point through the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they might treat with him to buy the places he had taken, and hire the Forces employed in forcing them, for in ſuch a Juncture it would be impoſſible for <hi>Spain</hi> to preſerve that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In that proſpect <hi>Ferdinand</hi> propoſed to himſelf by the means of <hi>France</hi> to divert the ſtorm that threatned him, and had his recourſe to the mediation of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53255:107"/> 
               <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelſth to hinder <hi>Maximilian</hi> from making War once more in <hi>Italy. Louis</hi> had received cauſes of diſſatisfaction from the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> that he could not think of pardoning. It had hindered him from recovering the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> wherein had it not been for that Republick he muſt have ſucceeded, and they had plainly enough intimated by their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours at <hi>Paris,</hi> that they would engage in all Leagues that might be formed againſt the diſturbers of the peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> Since their politick reſolutions were unalterable, and that there was no other expedient to take them off from the execution of the Counſels taken in the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> but by attacking them ſo powerfully that they ſhould have buſineſs enough to defend themſelves, <hi>Louis</hi> laboured to turn againſt them the four moſt conſiderable Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> which were the <hi>Holy See, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the cauſes of the League of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray.</hi>
               </note> The Union of ſo many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of ſo contrary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and intereſts did not appear very difficult, becauſe there was none of them from whom the Republick did not keep Towns which they would be very glad to recover. In the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate they poſſeſſed the moſt Important places of the Province of <hi>Romania:</hi> in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53255:108"/> the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> the Towns lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River of <hi>Adda: Iſtria</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> the places which heretofore the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had held by engagement; and in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> the maritime Towns of <hi>Apulia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> ſecretly negotiated the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of that League; and they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt agreed, when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> repreſented to the moſt Chriſtian King that if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented not the miſunderſtanding that was like to degenerate into an open War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Catholick Majeſty and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; the Union of the four Potentates would be interrupted, and perhaps would not all be formed by reaſon of the diſtruſt that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second might have, that if he joyned alone with the <hi>French,</hi> ſeeing they had many more Forces than he, they might alone make their proſit of all the ſpoils of the <hi>Venetians. Louis</hi> aſſaulted on the weak ſide, employed his Miniſters to reconcile his two moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies, and beſtirred himſelf in it ſo vigorouſly, that by his patience and perſeverance he ſurpaſſed the great diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that he met with therein.</p>
            <p>The Emperour and Catholick King by his mediation diſpoſed of the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to which neither the one or other had any other right but that of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53255:108"/> as if they had been uncontrovertibly their own; and though the Laws of the Country called to the Government the eldeſt of their Grandchildren when he was compleat Eighteen years of age, yet they put him off by their own private authority till he were five and twenty. The Emperour reſted content with a Penſion of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns a year for all the pretenſions he had to <hi>Caſtile</hi> in quality of Paternal Grandfather to the two young Princes who were the lawful Heirs of it; and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King ſecured himſelf at ſo eaſie a rate; to reign ſo long as he lived as abſolutely in that Monarchy as he did in <hi>Arragon.</hi>

               <hi>Chievres</hi> with extreme indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the news of the concluſion of ſo unreaſonable a Treaty, and laid two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable intrigues to break it off before it began to be put in execution, the one was at the Court of <hi>France</hi> by the Counteſs of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> the Mother of <hi>Francis</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Succeſſour to <hi>Louis,</hi> the other in <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Margarite</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom we have mentioned before. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> repreſented to the moſt Chriſtian King that the Accommodation which he had made betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was equally contrary to the Juſtice which he owed to himſelf, and to that which he owed to the moſt illuſtrious
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53255:109"/> Feudatary of his Crown: That the three attempts made by his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for the recovery of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> in ſeven years time ſince he loſt it, were ſufficient to convince him that he could not ſucceed in it ſo long as the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> acted in concert to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from entering it, as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their diſ-union would infallibly open to him the way; and that notwithſtanding his Majeſty inſtead of taking all courſes to ſet <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at variance, and at leaſt of taking the advantage of the diviſion fallen out betwixt them without his having a hand in it, as he might in Conſcience have done, had interpoſed to make them friends, and that ſucceſsfully too; which was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to all true Frenchmen, that they were ſenſible that had it not been for that Mediation, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> would have been entirely reunited to the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy: That the late King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had upon his death-bed left the diſpoſition of his eldeſt Son to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; that beſides he held of him, becauſe of his Counties of <hi>Flanders, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charolois:</hi> that he had indeed provided for the Education of that young Prince, but that it ſeemed at preſent he had repented of the good he had done

Theſe urgent reaſons of the Counteſs made no impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the mind of <hi>Louis,</hi> becauſe his Majeſty neither could nor would undo his own work; and if <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſtrangely troubled at it, he had occaſion to take comfort, in that his Pupil had afterwards the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> could never have ſeized, had he not been King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> as well as of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in the Juncture that offered four years after.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53255:110"/> was cheated in it more than the half of the juſt value but alſo he reſerved not thereby the hundredth part of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, and would ruine the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by dividing it, in ſuch a manner as it could never be re-united again: That all <hi>Europe</hi> was perſuaded that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> loved the younger Son incomparably better than the elder; and that there were ſuch evident marks of that preference, that it could not be doubted, ſeeing he had given his name to the younger: That he took a particular care of his education: that he viſited him time after time in the Colledge of <hi>Alcala,</hi> where he ſtudied: and that he brought him up in the hopes of being one day King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> That it would be very hard to hinder that odd deſign, if the Catholick King reigned in <hi>CAſtile</hi> till the Archduke were five and twenty years of age compleat, becauſe that long ſpace of time would be ſufficient to ſettle the young <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſo firm in <hi>Spain,</hi> that though his elder Brother had a mind to force him thence, yet he could not be able to do it; and the hatred of the two Brothers would become indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in that the elder would always lay claim to the Monarchies which his younger Brother had uſurped from him; and the younger would ſtill be upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53255:110"/> his guard againſt his elder Brother, in the ſole proſpect of maintaining his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: whereas if the Emperour had the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile</hi> during the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of the Archduke, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Monarchy for him, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would from thence ſo carefully watch all the actions of the Catholick King, that it would be almoſt impoſſible for him to raiſe young <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Arragon.</hi> If contrary to all appearance the Affair might ſtill ſucceed, yet young <hi>Ferdinand</hi> could not long ſit on the Throne to which his Benefactor had raiſed him, and there would be ſo little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt his Forces and thoſe of his elder Brother, that he would be ſoon ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which could not befall him if he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the two Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſeeing in that caſe his elder Brother muſt croſs over all <hi>France,</hi> to which the moſt Chriſtian King would never conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> had no more regard to the Remonſtrances of <hi>Margarite</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> than the moſt Chriſtian King had to thoſe of the Counteſs of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> whether it was that the word of his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was already too far engaged, or that he apprehended not the inconveniences which <hi>Chievres</hi> foreſaw. His Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with the Catholick King was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53255:111"/> concluded: he had his fifty thouſand Crowns a year that were promiſed him duly payed; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> reigned ſo long as he lived with as much authority in <hi>Caſtile</hi> as <hi>Arragon,</hi> though he had no right over the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and was lawful King of the <hi>Arragoneſe.</hi> But it ſeldom happens that private men concern themſelves in the quarrels of their Sovereigns ſcotfree; for if the Party they adhered to get the better of the other, they ſeldom obtain a reward proportionable to the greatneſs of their ſervices; and if they ſuccumb, the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince for whom they declared, abandons them to the diſcretion of the happy Prince whom they have offended, or at leaſt takes no care to comprehend them in his Articles of Agreement, which is almoſt the ſame as if he abandoned them. There was no mention neither of <hi>Chievres</hi> nor of <hi>Manuel</hi> made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the Emperour and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King; but the Archdukes Governour ſuſtained no prejudice thereby, and all the ſtorm broke upon the Favourite of his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> durſt not attempt to remove <hi>Chievres</hi> from his Grandſon <hi>Charles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, who had placed him there, would have been concerned in honour to have maintained him; and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53255:111"/> beſides the People of the Low Countries would not have ſuffered him to have been depoſed, with what pretext ſoever that change had been coloured. But <hi>Manuel,</hi> who had not ſo good a back, remained without a Protector: <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed him without ſcruple; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made it a Principle of policy to drive him to the utmoſt extremity. By that means he thought to over aw the more reſtleſs ſpirits of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and to render them ſo tractable that they would trouble him no more in the adminiſtration of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. It happened however that the People of the Low Countries where <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> had taken ſanctuary ſeconded but in half the violence of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. They conſented, indeed, that <hi>Manuel</hi> ſhould be committed to Priſon: but they would not comply with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> to bring him to a Trial before the Supreme Court of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In vain his Catholick Majeſty declared himſelf Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and offered to make it out in lawful form, that he had been the only cauſe of the miſ-underſtanding that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf and the late King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> his son-in-law. They ſhifted his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by ſending him this poſitive anſwer, That it belonged not to the Subjects of the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> ſuch as were the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53255:112"/> Judges of the Low Countries, to try an Affair that concerned another Subject of that Prince, born in a Country far remote from theirs, and over whom they had no Juriſdiction, the Crimes in queſtion not having been committed in <hi>Flanders:</hi> That they were willing to believe upon the word of his Majeſty that <hi>Manuel</hi> was guilty, becauſe he had been ſo unhappy as to give him occaſion to think him ſo; and that it was only upon that account that they had made ſure of his Perſon, that they would keep him in ſafe cuſtody, and be anſwerable for him. But that ſeeing the Archduke was concerned in the Affair by reaſon of his Fathers repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which might be blemiſhed; there was a neceſſity of ſtaying till he was of age, and that the Laws of <hi>Caſtile</hi> gave him Authority to aſſiſt at the Judgment of a <hi>Caſtilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was not ſatisfied with that excuſe: But it being impoſſible for him to obtain any more againſt <hi>Manuel,</hi> he did not complain; and the <hi>Flemings</hi> denied <hi>Manuel</hi> nothing which he deſired to eaſe the irkſomneſs of a Priſon. He continued there until the death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and came out immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="margin">In the laſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi>
               </note>. His gratitude to the Archduke, who went in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53255:112"/> Perſon with <hi>Chievres</hi> to take him out of Priſon was ſuch, that thereafter he ſtirred up in his favours all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and gave him the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of taking from them the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The big belly of the Queen <hi>Germana</hi> was more than ſufficient to comfort <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> for that the ſole <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> whom he had propoſed to undo, had eſcaped from his revenge. His Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had in the year One thouſand five hundred and nine a Son, who without diſpute ought to diſappoint the Archduke of the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, Minorca, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> The late King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> agreed to that, and the <hi>Great Captain</hi> had approved for that end the tranſaction paſſed betwixt that Prince and his Father-in-law: But it is in vain for men to ſtrive to avoid the Decrees of Heaven. <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> new Son lived but an hour; and the Catholick King was more ſenſibly touched with grief at the loſs of him, than he had been affected with joy at his birth. He turned his reſentment againſt the Perſon in the world who had moſt obliged him; and that Perſon defended himſelf in the way that ableſt Courtiers take to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of their Maſters, which is that of a diverſion.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:53255:113"/>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Francis de Ciſneros Ximenes</hi> was the man of all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whoſe outſide beſt agreed with the inſide, and in whoſe countenance, thoſe who knew leaſt of Phyſiognomy could very hardly have been deceived even though they would. He was of a goodly ſtature; a well proportioned body; a healthful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; ſteady gate; ſtrong voice; grave countenance; his countenance was long and withered: his forehead large, and ſo ſmooth that age wrinkled it not: his eyes ſmall and hollow, but quick and piercing, though they were always watery: his noſe long and aquiline: his fore-teeth ſet ſo far outward, that he went by the Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of the Elephant: his lips thick: his cheſt long, and his head without any future, as it appeared to them who found his Skull forty years after his death when they were repairing the Vault where his body was laid: to which are attributed thoſe fearful headaches wherewith he was ſo frequently tormented; contrary to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who never felt any pain of the head, becauſe he had in his Crown two little holes, through which the vapours exhaled.</p>
            <p>The prudence of <hi>Ximenes</hi> carried it from that of the Cardinal of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> chief Miniſter of State to the moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53255:113"/> King <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth. It had always inclined the advantage to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide againſt <hi>France,</hi> when thoſe two Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies fell into competition. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> was, indeed, ſlower in deliberation than the <hi>French-man,</hi> but to make amends for that he prevented him in the execution when once he had taken his ſide, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remitted, as he did, till he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed what he had begun: difficulties enlivened inſtead of diſcouraging him. Choler, to which he was ſubject, never ſo far tranſported him as to make him ſay any thing, or do any action, that he might have cauſe afterward to repent of. He was ſo punctual in keeping of his word, that it never went out of his mind till he had fulfilled it. His deep Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly obliged him to delight in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe who uſed to make Jeſts: but he himſelf never ſpake any, and it was perhaps for fear of meeting with ſharp repartees, for he was but the Son of a Proctor of <hi>Tortelaguna</hi> in old <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and he had ſpent his youth amongſt the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> before that Order was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The ſole conſideration of his worth had advanced him to be Guardian and Provincial of his Order; and he actually diſcharged the laſt of the two when it pleaſed Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> to chuſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53255:114"/> him for her Confeſſor. He endeavoured to have excuſed himſelf, and did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it but becauſe that Princeſs would needs have him to be the depoſitary of her greateſt ſecrets. Nevertheleſs one of his moſt intimate friends pleaſantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it as of a piece of Infidelity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted towards him, and upbraided him that he forſook him to go to Court. Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſenſible already of the reach and ability of his Genius, when by the following accident ſhe was excited to give him the chief Eccleſiaſtical Dignity of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza</hi> was ſick, and the Phyſicians deſpaired of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who were extraordinarily obliged to him, did him the honour to give him a viſit, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> privately conjured him to tell her ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly if he had no thoughts of any who he deſired might ſucceed to him. The Cardinal anſwered, that it was indifferent to him, provided his Succeſſour deſerved the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo. Iſabella</hi> inſiſted: She conjured him to name to her the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> whom he judged worthieſt, and the Cardinal without heſitation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that <hi>Ximenes</hi> was the man. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> raviſhed at that Authentick teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which gave her occaſion to promote
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53255:114"/> her Confeſſor to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo</hi> without giving offence to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, cauſed his Brief to be expeded upon the death of the Cardinal, and ſhortly after brought him into the Council of State. He acquired a prodigious repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there in reſpect that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which he moved or ſeconded hardly ever failed to ſucceed; as on the contrary, thoſe which he rejected were commonly unſucceſsful: but in exchange he attracted the enmity of the greateſt Nobility of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> No Miniſter of State in <hi>Spain</hi> that ever went before him, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in ſo high a degree, that ſo rare a virtue in a States-man which the holy Scripture calls <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs.</hi> He could not endure that great men ſhould oppreſs their Vaſſals; and when a poor Peaſant applied himſelf to him to demand Juſtice for the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Lord, he rendered it upon the ſpot, if it depended ſolely on him, and procured it by all his credit if it was not in his own power without caring for what might follow. The murmurings of the perſons of quality were ſo much the greater at that, that for many ages they had been accuſtomed to treat their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours according to their fancy. That abuſe proceeded from the priviledge the Nobles
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53255:115"/> took to themſelves becauſe it was chiefly they who recovered the Country from the <hi>Moors.</hi> Upon that ground alone they were perſuaded that all <hi>Caſtile</hi> belonged to them by the right of Conqueſt; and that they did no injury to Catholick Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who lived only there by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when they left them no more of the Crop they ſowed and reaped, but what they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> had always been indulgent to theſe petty Tyrants, whether it was that they feared to excite the great men to revolt, who otherwiſe were but too ſubject to it, or that they themſelves had an intereſt in the continuance of that diſorder, becauſe in their own Lands they uſed the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences that the Gentlemen committed in theirs. Therefore the Great men of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> complained to Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> oftener than once of the Cardinal, and preſſed her to ſend him home to his Church, where they thought he would not be any more ſo troubleſome to them. But <hi>Iſabella</hi> always cluded their deſire by anſwering, that that Prelate was ſo uſeful to her, that though he were at <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhe muſt of neceſſity diſpatch a Courrier with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for him inſtantly to repair to Court. Thereupon ſhe imparted to them in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53255:115"/> general the important affairs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the preſence of that Prelate; and if ſhe diſmiſſed them not with ſatisfaction, yet ſhe took from them the pretext of making Inſurrections upon the account their deſire had been refuſed. So they ſeparated, and returned to their Caſtles without daring to attempt the perſon of <hi>Ximenes;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In the Life of Cardinal <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi>
               </note> for beſides that he was more powerful than any one of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, not excepting the Dukes of <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Infantado,</hi> and never went but well guarded; the People, who acknowledged him for their Protector, were in all places ſo well affected towards him, that the greateſt Cowards in the place where he might have been attacked, would have made no difficulty to hazard their lives to ſave his. In this condition he continued till the death of the Queen his Benefactrice; and thereafter became ſo uſeful during the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for accommodating him with his Father-in-law, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> durſt not undertake to diſgrace him: but after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> and the Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his Catholick Majeſty thought that there was nothing wanting to gain the general good will of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53255:116"/> Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> but to ſacrifice to them <hi>Ximenes.</hi> He long conſidered how he might moſt ſecurely diſgrace him, and at length pitched upon the following method.</p>
            <p>He cauſed it to be repreſented to him that he had too much wit not to perceive that the hatred which the great men of <hi>Caſtile</hi> bore him was irreconcilable, and that it would not fail to break out in time and place convenient: That hitherto they had been reſtrained by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they had for the late Queen, and their affection to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> but that now, that Prince was dead, that his Widow was diſtracted, without any hopes of recovery, and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> only reigned in <hi>Caſtile</hi> with the Title of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious King, that is to ſay, as Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of that Monarchy during the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Grandchildren, his Catholick Majeſty durſt not promiſe to protect him for the future againſt ſuch a multitude of potent enemies: that notwithſtanding it would deſperately afflict him to have failed in it for two reaſons; firſt, becauſe he was extremely obliged to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and then that his weakneſs would appear too evidently when it ſhould come to be known in <hi>Europe</hi> that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> could not ſnatch his Chief Miniſter out of the hands
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53255:116"/> of incenſed <hi>Caſtilians:</hi> That there was no other remedy for that inconvenience but the tranſlation of <hi>Ximenes</hi> from the chief See of the Churches of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where the Royal Authority would be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected than as it pleaſed the Grandees, to the firſt See of the Churches of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> where it was abſolute, and all that could be done for <hi>Ximenes</hi> was to oblige the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> to exchange with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> underſtood very well that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had a mind to his Benefice, and prudently judged that it behoved him at firſt to put him out of hopes of it. He made anſwer to this purpoſe, That for his life he valued it not much, ſeeing he had taken, and what in him lay executed the deſign of ſpending it wholly in the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Cordeliers:</hi> That the Catholick King knew very well how he was pulled out from thence to be made eſpouſe of the Church of <hi>Toledo:</hi> and that his Majeſty might very well remember that oftener than once he had proteſted to Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> when ſhe commanded him to take ſuch a Wife, that he would never forſake her till death: that it was to no purpoſe then to ſpeak to him of exchange, nor to preſs him to reſign, ſince nothing would be got by it: That if the great men of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53255:117"/> 
               <hi>Caſtile</hi> attacked him ſeparately, they ſhould meet with their match; and if they united againſt him, he had power enough to prevent himſelf from being run down at firſt, till he might have aſſiſtance from the King his Maſter; that if that aſſiſtance failed him not, as he had ground to hope it would not, he would eaſily bring his Enemies to reaſon; and if it failed him at a pinch, yet he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf in his Archbiſhoprick as long as he could, and if he were reduced to extremity, take Shipping and croſs the Seas that he might find fanctuary in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country at leaſt, if he were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there according to his quality. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at firſt underſtood not the true meaning of the laſt words of <hi>Ximenes</hi> which were faithfully reported to him; but he underſtood them but too well in the ſequel, when that Prelate wrote to the Emperour, and to the Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that there was an apparent deſign of turning him out of his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, as a puniſhment for having been the firſt of the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> that owned <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for their King, and becauſe there was no hopes for raiſing to the Throne one of the natural Sons of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> in prejudice of the lawful Children ſo long as he was Primate of <hi>Spain.</hi> The
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53255:117"/> Letters of the Cardinal grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon chiefly the protection which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from thoſe two Princes. But <hi>Ximenes</hi> wrote a third Letter to <hi>Chievres,</hi> acquainting him that the Archduke was chiefly concerned that he ſhould remain at the head of the Clergy, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would no ſooner loſe his hopes of raiſing his natural Son to the Thrones of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi>

That in that ſecond attempt he would infallibly ſucceed, if baffled in the firſt, if he made ſure of him whom he ſhould prefer in the place of <hi>Ximenes</hi> to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> becauſe that new Prelate being the chief of the Eſtates, would ſway all the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that might be made there: That the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> agreed in one point, though they had a terrible Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in all things elſe; and that that Point was not to admit of a Sovereign, but of one that ſhould always live in <hi>Spain:</hi> That <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who knew their inclination, needed do no more to diſpoſe firſt the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and then the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the order of Nature, but to repreſent
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53255:118"/> to them, that if they took the Archduke for their King, the Imperial Dignity that was like to deſcend upon him after the death of his Paternal Grandfather, the hereditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> that he muſt neceſſarily enjoy as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eldeſt of the Family, and the Low Countries which he already poſſeſſed, would employ him ſo often, and ſo long, that very ſeldom he could come into <hi>Spain;</hi> and ſo ſoon as he were there, he would be preſſed again to be gone: That on the contrary, if the two Monarchies of <hi>Spain</hi> took the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for their King, ſeeing he would have no other States to govern, he would remain conſtantly in <hi>Spain,</hi> and not go into <hi>Italy</hi> but once at moſt, and that occaſionally as his Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grandfather had done: That the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> being convinced by that only reaſon would prefer the younger before the elder Brother; whereas if his Catholick Majeſty were not ſure of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his intention to the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> becauſe he might ſuppoſe he would be baffled in it; and that if the Affair paſſed not in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> it would not be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to paſs in <hi>Arragon.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> thereupon renewed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of fidelity to the Archduke;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53255:118"/> and ſo convincingly perſuaded his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the neceſſity of maintaining him in the Benefice to which he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that <hi>Chievres</hi> inclined the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Archduke to take infallible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for protecting him againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King. And in effect theſe two Princes wrote in concert to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that the reputation of Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that the only perſon whom ſhe had raiſed higheſt ſhould not be depreſſed; and that it ſtruck alſo at the honour of the late King <hi>Philip,</hi> ſeeing if <hi>Ximenes</hi> were depoſed, it would not fail to be ſaid that it was for having given bad counſels to that young Prince. That if his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty pretended <hi>Ximenes</hi> had offended him, the Law was open to call him to an account for it; and that neither the Emperour nor the Archduke would take it ill if he brought him to a fair Trial: but that if he took a violent courſe, ſeeing he could not do it without raiſing a Civil War in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and that it concerned the Emperour and Archduke to prevent it, he ought not to take exceptions if they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to do it in the manner they judged moſt proper.</p>
            <p>The threatning which was plainly enough intimated in the laſt words mentioned, put <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to a ſtand, and diſarmed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53255:119"/> his reſentment. He foreſaw that ſeeing he had no lawful Male Iſſue he would commit an irreparable fault if he contented not himſelf with the adminiſtration of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and in reigning peaceably during his life. He made reflection that he was about to deprive himſelf of both theſe advantages if he drove <hi>Ximenes</hi> to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: that in that caſe it would coſt him more in <hi>Caſtile</hi> than he got out of it, and that he would hamper himſelf in a quarrel that muſt at leaſt laſt as long as he: That he would, indeed, have the Nobility of <hi>Caſtile</hi> on his ſide, but that on the other hand, the People and honeſt men would declare for <hi>Ximenes:</hi> and that ſo the Forces being almoſt equal, the War would be long, and the Iſſue without doubt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. That if his Catholick Majeſty were overcome, the high reputation which he had acquired would be wholly blaſted; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would no more be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him for the Conqueſts of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> becauſe he would have cauſed them more prejudice by dividing them than he had done them good by making them great: beſides the ſhame that would redound unto him by being beaten by a <hi>Cordelier.</hi> So that the leaſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that could befall him would be to be confined to <hi>Arragon</hi> for the reſt of his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53255:119"/> days; and that he would have a continual vexation a thouſand times worſe than death, to ſee his victorious Adverſary poſſeſſing in <hi>Caſtile</hi> the place which by his own imprudence he had loſt. If he triumphed over <hi>Ximenes</hi> the glory of it would not be great; and ſeeing the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and profeſſion of his Adverſary would excuſe him from venturing his Perſon, he would have no more to do after his Forces were defeated, but to take Shipping and flie to <hi>Flanders.</hi> That the Archdukes Letter gave ſufficient intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he would be well received there, and that nevertheleſs he would not fail to do <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as much miſchief from thence, as he would have done had he been victorious in <hi>Caſtile;</hi> that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues he would croſs all the Projects of his Catholick Majeſty: That he would raiſe him more buſineſs than he could make an end of: That by infinite pains and labour he would make him purchaſe the pleaſure of adminiſtring the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his Grandchildren; and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might diſpoſe the Archduke, who for all he was ſo young was already through the care of his Governour be come fit to reign, not to ſtay till he were of age for going into <hi>Spain;</hi> and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to deliver up to him
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53255:120"/> the poſſeſſion of the Monarchy of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> as quickly and eaſily, as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had forced him to do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Princes, who comply beſt with the neceſſity of their affairs, are ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſooneſt; and ſo ſoon as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was convinced that he muſt be reconciled to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> he did it with good grace without employing a Mediator. <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſurpriſed to find himſelf ſo ſoon contrary to all expectation rid of ſo troubleſom an Affair; and not truſting too much to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> conſidered long what courſe to take for his own ſecurity. He ſound no better expedient for avoiding the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of his Catholick Majeſty, than at his own charge, and by his own credit to raiſe an Army of ſixteen thouſand men, and to command them in perſon for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Ports of <hi>Barbary,</hi> that lay moſt conveniently for the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He ſuppoſed that by that means he would deſerve the univerſal approbation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and that if he appeaſed not the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would take from them even the pretext of doing him any hurt. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would have no more cauſe to envy his vaſt Revenues, nor to accuſe him of ill employing them; and if nevertheleſs he did do ſo, he would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53255:120"/> purchaſe to himſelf the indignation of all men. The Vaſſals of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> would be enured to War; and their Prelate being in the midſt of them, would have no cauſe to fear any thing. If his enterpriſe in <hi>Affrica</hi> ſucceeded, no man in <hi>Spain</hi> would for the future have the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to attack him; and if it ſucceeded not, he would at leaſt have this conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his deſign would meet with ſo much approbation, that they would ſtill reſpect the Author though they ſhould hear that he had miſcarried in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ximenes</hi> levied Forces, fitted out Ships, laid aſide the Frock and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Habit, armed Cap-a-pee, and croſſed over fortunately into <hi>Barbary.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Profeſſion was a new thing to him, and he underſtood no more of it but what he had heard diſcourſed of in the Council of <hi>Spain:</hi> yet it happened to him as to <hi>Lucullus</hi> which the Roman Hiſtory cannot ſufficiently admire. He became a Captain in the ſhort time that he was paſſing over the narrow Streights which divide <hi>Spain</hi> from <hi>Affrica,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> and at firſt diſcharged the moſt difficult duty of a General, which is by his ſingle Authority to quell ſeditions come to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53255:121"/> maturity. He was hardly landed when the moſt reſolute of his Soldiers, who had thought it no ſmall honour to be liſted under his Colours, were aſhamed actually to ſerve under a <hi>Cordelier.</hi> They took the firſt pretext that offered to decline it, and deſired to be carried back to <hi>Spain. Ximenes</hi> was not ſtartled nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at their multitude, nor their revolt: he ruſhed into the midſt of them: took the boldeſt of the company by the Collar, cauſed him to be put to death upon the ſpot; and ſo terrified the reſt, that they mutinied no more.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Oran,</hi> the Capital of a Kingdom to which it gave the name, was afterwards attacked, and taken by ſtorm: <hi>Bugy,</hi> where the Univerſity of the <hi>Moors</hi> was, and the only place known in <hi>Affrica,</hi> where they went to learn the little of Arts and Sciences which they have, was as eaſily conquered. The occaſion that <hi>Ximenes</hi> had of ſeizing it deſerves to be known, were it for no other reaſon but to convince us, that if Chriſtians took as much care to be informed of the affairs of Infidels, as Infidels take to learn what news happen amongſt Chriſtians, we ſhould get more by it than they, and find a a great many favourable occaſions which are loſt for want of that application.</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:53255:121"/>
            <p>The Uncle of the King of <hi>Bugy</hi> by the Father, a few days before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drew near that Kingdom, thought it not enough to dethrone his Nephew, but alſo put out his eye-ſight with a hot Iron, that thereby he might render him incapable of reigning, and prevent, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, the deſigns of thoſe who pretended afterward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh him upon the Throne during the life of the Uſurper, or immediately after his death. <hi>Ximenes</hi> accidentally was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ſo barbarous an action, and preſently reſolved to make his advantage of it. He ſent word to the friends of the diſpoſſeſſed King, that he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily revenge the injury that was done if they would act in concert with him, and there needed no more to raiſe in the Kingdom of <hi>Bugy</hi> a ſecond revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as great as the former. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that was worſted took courage again, and quickly ſetled ſecret correſpondences with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who they thought had offered themſelves to them out of a principle of generoſity. They took ſo juſt meaſures with them that they facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the taking of places that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hinder them from approaching the Capital City; and then brought them into
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53255:122"/> 
               <hi>Bugy</hi> by means that were kept ſo ſecret after the execution of them, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtorians diſagree about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This is certain, that an accident ſupervened, which was ſo much the more favourable to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for winning that other Crown of <hi>Barbary,</hi> that not being ſo skilful in medicine as they had been in the time of <hi>Averroes</hi> and <hi>Avienne,</hi> they took it for a miracle.</p>
            <p>The red-hot Iron that had been made uſe of to blind the King by holding it near his eyes a quarter of an hour, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deprived him of ſight, but had not wholly dried up the humours; whether it was that the Miniſters of the Uſurpers cruelty had taken it out of the fire before it was hot enough for the intended ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; or that it was not put near enough his eyes, and held there a ſufficient time for drying entirely up the humidity which ſerves to the functions of ſight. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chirurgions perceived it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to cure the Mooriſh King. The cure was long and difficult, but at length it ſucceeded, and was look'd upon as well by him upon whom it was wrought as by his Subjects, as an evident mark that it was the purpoſe of heaven that they ſhould be Tributaries to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53255:122"/> Corſairs of <hi>Algiers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the relation of that Conqueſt.</note> who till then had with impunity deſtroyed the Chriſtian Fleets, and ſpoil'd the Commerce of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> followed the example of thoſe of <hi>Bugy,</hi> and ſubmitted to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame tribute. In a word, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by an exceſs of good fortune which they have not had ſince in their Wars againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Kingdom of <hi>Tripoli;</hi> and <hi>Ximenes</hi> returned to his Church of <hi>Toledo</hi> with ſo much glory and booty, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> durſt think no more of moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>
            <p>In this manner the Archduke <hi>Charles</hi> reaped ſo much advantage from the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of that Prelate and his Maternal Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, that three illuſtrious Kingdoms and a more famous Republick were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſubjected to him; and ſhortly after, in the year One thouſand five hundred and twelve, the ſame good fortune brought under his Dominion the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> when neither he himſelf, nor his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Chievres</hi> had any hand in it. That Monarchy had often fallen to Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by conſequent had ſucceſſively paſſed into ſeveral Families. By that way it was transferred from the ancient
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53255:123"/> Houſe of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to that of <hi>Leon:</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Leon</hi> to that of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to that of <hi>Champagne:</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Champagne</hi> to that of <hi>France:</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>France</hi> to that of <hi>Evreux:</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Evreux</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Arragon:</hi> and from the Houſe of <hi>Arragon</hi> to that of <hi>Foix-Grailly. Gaſton de Foix</hi> married <hi>Eleanor</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſecond Siſter to the Father of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick King, by whom he had twelve Children of both Sexes. The eldeſt Son died at two and twenty years of age, he left a Son and a Daughter whom he had of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the youngeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh. The Son, named <hi>Francis Phoebus,</hi> reigned not long in <hi>Navarre,</hi> and died before he was married. The Daughter named <hi>Catharine</hi> became thereby the richeſt Heireſs of <hi>Europe.</hi> She remained under the Guardianſhip of her Mother, who would never hear of marrying again, though ſhe was a Widow at the age of ſeventeen years. There were but few Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> that courted not the Alliance of the young Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre;</hi> and the moſt conſiderable Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that was propoſed to her was the Inſanto of <hi>Spain, John</hi> the Son of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> who was much of the ſame age with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53255:123"/> her. That Prince was the only Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and if he had married <hi>Catharine,</hi> all the Monarchies of <hi>Spain</hi> had been reunited, except that of <hi>Portugal. Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> deſigned that chiefly by the Match: But <hi>Magdalen</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had not ſo great an averſion to the Houſe ſhe was come of, as to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the raiſing in <hi>Spain</hi> a Power almoſt equal to that of <hi>France.</hi> She abſolutely refuſed her Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Spain;</hi> but for all that ſhe had not ſo much kindneſs for the Houſe of <hi>France</hi> as to marry her Daughter into it, as ſhe had not ſo much affection for her Daughter as to marry her into a Sovereign Family. She gave her to <hi>John</hi> Son of <hi>Alan d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> a powerful Lord, indeed, in <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,</hi> but who poſſeſſed not a foot of Land but what held of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> in quality of Dukes of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Irregularities in Politicks are of more dangerous conſequence than others; and it is rare to be found in Hiſtory, that Queens of themſelves have married Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands inferiour to them in quality with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having great occaſions of repenting it. <hi>John d' Albert</hi> ſeemed born to veriſie the old Proverb, That the beſt men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt Kings. He had all the qualities
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53255:124"/> that could accompliſh a private man; but he wanted thoſe which diſtinguiſh Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns from thoſe that are not, and were not cut out for being ſo. He delighted only in ſtudy, and minded nothing by his good will but collecting of Manuſcripts, and ſetting up Libraries. There was not a Houſe of any note in <hi>Europe</hi> but he could upon the ſpot blazon its Coat of Arms, and deduce the Genealogy thereof; and though no man knew better than he that Nobility is only the reward of merit, and that he could not more ſenſibly affront the Gentry of <hi>Navarre</hi> than by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing amongſt them perſons altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undeſerving, yet he did but too often give them occaſion of vexing at his conduct in that particular; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that he ſuffered himſelf to be wheedled by flattery, or that he could not reſiſt long importunities. He had learned in <hi>Guyenne</hi> to treat with his Vaſſals as a ſimple Gentleman; and that familiarity which was reckoned a virtue in him ſo long as he continued in <hi>France,</hi> became his greateſt vice when he was in <hi>Spain,</hi> the People of that Country eſteeming none more enormous, than that which is moſt inconſiſtent with gravity. Royal Majeſty was to him inſupportable in all the actions that were not of Ceremony:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53255:124"/> At other times he loved to live in an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which he called the Cement of Civil Society: He went willingly to ſuch places where he was invited to eat, provided the company conſiſted only of Gentlemen of breeding; and the firſt thing he did when he was come, was to forget for ſome time that he was King, and to be willing that the Maſter of the Houſe and the Gueſts ſhould forget it as well as he, ſeeing he was very pleaſant company, he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted at leaſt as much to their mirth as they did to his; and when he came to know of any feaſt made in <hi>Pampelona</hi> the chief City of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whether out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they durſt not invite him, he invited himſelf, and put the People to no charges, for then he went commonly alone. He loved dancing the more that in it he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all the Princes of his Age; and when upon a Journey he found by the way companies of Towns or Country people who diverted themſelves that way, he ſtruck in and danced with them. He had ſo great antipathy againſt State affairs when he found them thorny, that he abandoned them entirely to the care of his Miniſters, who not having the ſame intereſt in them as he had, ordered them many times according to their fancy.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:53255:125"/>
            <p>The greateſt abuſe that proceeded from thence was, that the Magiſtracies, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Offices, and Governments of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> were given to ſtrangers, and that the Remonſtrances made thereupon by the Eſtates of the Kingdom were fruitleſs. There is nothing Princes ought more to fear than the hatred and contempt of their Subjects: However they may boaſt that they are not altogether unfortunate when they fall but into the averſion alone, or into the contempt alone of the ſame Subjects; becauſe if they have only loſt their affection, the reverence that remains is ſufficient to keep them in obedience; and if they have only loſt the reverence affection ſupplies the defect: but when there is neither reverence nor affection, it is impoſſible to prevent revolutions in States, and to hinder them from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing univerſal when once they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> was no more reſpected by the <hi>Navarreſe</hi> by reaſon of his too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar way of living, and for all that reigned no leſs peaceably, becauſe he was no leſs beloved of the meaner ſort whom he treated as his equals, nor of the great men who well enough foreſaw that a Prince of that temper would never invade their Priviledges: but ſo ſoon as he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53255:125"/> attracted the hatred of both by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before them ſtrangers and perſons of mean virtue, nothing was then able to ſupport him, and he ſuccumbed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt attack that was made againſt him.</p>
            <p>For many Ages <hi>Navarre</hi> had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two almoſt equal Factions in power, the one was that of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> the other that of <hi>Grammont</hi> according to the old Titles of the Houſe which ſtill retains that name, and of <hi>Grammont</hi> according to the modern. The chief of the Houſe of <hi>Beaumont</hi> was the Count of <hi>Lerin</hi> heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Conſtable of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and the chief of the Houſe of <hi>Grammont</hi> was Lord of <hi>Tutelle</hi> and High Marſhal of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Count of <hi>Lerin</hi> had all the Qualities, or to ſay better, all the Vices that ancient and modern Hiſtories have obſerved in extraordinary men who have made themſelves Heads of Parties: His mind was the more malicious that neither Humanity nor Religion retained it upon any occaſion within bounds. He had killed the Father and only Brother of the Count of <hi>Tutelle,</hi> and for killing them had profaned what is moſt holy in the Catholick Religion. The Cardinal <hi>de Foix</hi> during the preceding Reign had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to reconcile the Families of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53255:126"/> 
               <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Grammont;</hi> and thought he had accompliſhed it when he had obliged the Conſtable and Marſhal of <hi>Navarre</hi> to promiſe ſolemnly that they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what was paſt, and for the future live in perfect friendſhip. After that he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Maſs, divided the Hoſt into two, and communicated both Parties: and yet this hindered not but that the Conſtable as ſoon as he came out of the Church went and way-laid the Marſhal with a purpoſe to aſſaſſinate him. He miſſed his blow, indeed, but left not off ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions afterwards of putting it in execution.</p>
            <p>The Marſhal on the contrary was a frank man; and who in all appearance departed not from the Maxims of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe he was not ſufficiently inſtructed in them. He ſuppoſed it was lawful to revenge the death of his Father and Brother, and the murder attempted upon his own Perſon, provided it were done publickly, and without treachery. The Conſtable and Marſhal had engaged into their quarrel all the Nobility of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and their private difference was inſenſibly degenerated into a Civil War, wherein their Neighbours had taken the part that intereſt or inclination ſuggeſted to them. The <hi>French</hi> declared for the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53255:126"/> Faction of <hi>Grammont,</hi> and the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> out of pure antipathy eſpouſed that of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> which was actually the moſt powerful in the City of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> when <hi>John d' Albert</hi> made his firſt entry into it. He favoured thoſe of <hi>Grammont</hi> before he married the Heireſs of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and the effects of it were ſo viſible, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People had as little cauſe to doubt of it as the Nobility.</p>
            <p>Thus the Conſtable had cauſe more than enough to diſtruſt the new King, and to fear being born down by him, if he received him at firſt, and without Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, into the Capital City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He had thereupon the boldneſs to ſhut the Gates upon him; and not to open them till after a Capitulation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>John d' Albert</hi> obliged himſelf in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not to meddle in the quarrel betwixt thoſe of <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Grammont</hi> upon any ground or pretext whatſoever. <hi>John d' Albert</hi> granted all that the Conſtable demanded of him, becauſe otherwiſe he could not have been Crowned with the common conſent of the Nobility of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre:</hi> but the affront ſeemed to him afterward to be too great to be diſſembled. He proſecuted the Conſtable firſt in the uſual courſe of Law, and then by Arms; but in ſo juſt a quarrel he was not ſeconded
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53255:127"/> as he expected to have been. The Faction of <hi>Grammont</hi> repaired, indeed, to his Banner, but the Conſtable alſo received aſſiſtance from two ſorts of people which he thought ought rather to have declared againſt him than for him.</p>
            <p>The firſt were thoſe who feared to be plundered by the Faction that ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely root out the other, and the other thoſe who being accuſtomed to live under a Monarchy where the Royal Power was almoſt as much limited as in the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the Collection of the Laws of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi>
               </note> would not have their King become abſolute by the overthrow of the Faction of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> or at leaſt that he ſhould be in a condition of growing ſo, if occaſion put him upon deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. So that the Party was no leſs equal when the King ſided with thoſe of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> than it was when the two Factions ſubſiſted only by their own Forces, and the Civil War was no leſs drawn out in length. <hi>John d' Albert</hi> being impatient to have an end put to it becauſe it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from his ordinary buſineſs, liſtned to the firſt propoſals of peace that were made to him, though they came from a Court every way to be ſuſpected.</p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:53255:127"/>

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick King being fruſtrated of his hopes of uniting <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi> by the Marriage of his only Son with <hi>Catharine de Foix,</hi> waited for an opportunity of ſeizing it by craft; and finding no more lawful fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unjuſt ways. He wanted a pretext of medling in the quarrel of thoſe of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Grammont</hi> before the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> interpoſed in it, becauſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of that time had that deference one for another not to take notice of what was done in neighbouring Kingdoms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were ſollicited to it. But after that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had declared againſt thoſe of <hi>Grammont;</hi> and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable their head apprehending at long run to ſuccumb under the force of the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> who would flock in to the ſuccour of <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> had had his recourſe to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Caſtilians; Ferdinand</hi> let not ſo favourable an occaſion ſlip, and managed it ſo cunningly, that at length it produced the effect which he expected from it.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable was his Brother-in-law as having married <hi>Eleanor,</hi> natural Daughter to the late <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and upon that conſideration chiefly he grounded his offer of mediation to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> for accommodating

               </gap> his Conſtable. The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who perceived not the drift of ſuch a Propoſition willingly accepted it; and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had no ſooner drawn him into the ſnare ſo cunningly laid, but that he prepared another for him more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the former. He paſſed inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in regard of his Majeſty of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> from a Mediation to a Guarranty, and over-reached him by repreſenting to him by Agents wonderfully cunning, that the Conſtable was not a man religious in keeping his word; and ſeeing the moſt ſacred and ſolemn Tie amongſt Chriſtians was not powerful enough to oblige him, he ought to bind him by ſo conſiderable a Guarant, that he durſt not unſay: That the King offered to take it upon him upon no other motive but of making and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining peace amongſt his Neighbours; and beſides, ſeeing there was no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that <hi>Navarre</hi> could be long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if the Conſtable departed not out of it for ſome years, his Catholick Majeſty was willing to allow him a retreat in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> ſuppoſing he ſhould refuſe to remove far from his Places for fear his Enemies might ſeize them in his abſence. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the mean time to keep them in Sequeſtration, and to put into them Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons ſufficient to maintain them: In a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53255:128"/> word, if nothing detained him in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> but the great Eſtates which he poſſeſſed there, he would give him the Equivalentor better in <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That overture at firſt ſeemed not to proceed but from a meer Principle of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity: Nevertheleſs examine it narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it could not be neither more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> nor more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to <hi>John d' Albert.</hi> For the moſt powerful Subject of his Majeſty of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> was confirmed in his revolt by making him treat on even terms with his Maſter, and by giving him <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> for Guarants of the Treaty which he ſhould make: occaſion was given to the moſt formidable Enemy of <hi>Navarre</hi> to make the Conſtable at his devotion when he ſhould be retired within his Territories: that Neighbour was received into the very Centre and beſt Places of <hi>Navarre,</hi> from whence he might eaſily uſurp the reſt of the Kingdom; and which was the greateſt ſhame in the world, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> muſt conſent that the Conſtable ſold himſelf, if I may ſo ſay, to the Catholick King, ſince it was propoſed that he ſhould receive conſiderable Eſtates from his Majeſty in recompence for his Revenues in <hi>Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:53255:129"/>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>John d' Albert</hi> ſigned the Treaty with all the above-mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Gariſons took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Places of the Conſtable, who went and lived at the Court of his Brother-in-law. The Catholick King was Surety for him that he ſhould raiſe no ſtirs in <hi>Navarre,</hi> and gave him not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, but alſo the Propriety of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate of <hi>Hueſcar</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> the Revenue whereof exceeded the Rents which he had in <hi>Navdrre.</hi> All the Politicians of the Age foretold the ruine of <hi>John d' Albert</hi> becauſe of that, and to ſpeak the truth, it ſeemed that it could not otherwiſe he than as they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted: But God Almighty does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways permit that Sovereigns, who are not ſo skilful in the Art of Government, ſuffer ſo ſoon the puniſhment of their imprudence; as he does not always neither permit the more ſubtil in that Art, to reap the fruit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> took a Journey into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> to ſollicite the reſtitution of ſome places in the Principality of <hi>Viane,</hi> which the Predeceſſors of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had uſurped from the Anceſtors of the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi> There he found the Count of <hi>Lerin</hi> his Conſtable, with whom he made
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53255:129"/> ſo ſincere a reconciliation, that the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were no leſs ſurpriſed than vexed at it. The Conſtable, who for alliance and gratitudes ſake was engaged in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> leapt all of a ſudden and without reſerve from the Intereſts of his Brother-in-law and Benefactor to thoſe of his Maſter, and adviſed <hi>John d' Albert</hi> not to liſten to the Propoſals of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King which he offered of money to be paid within certain terms for the places that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from him. It was the Artifice of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that having no intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them, and finding as yet no pretext of detaining them, he would defer the reſtitution of them to another time, under colour that the War he was engaged in with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo employed him that he had no time to examine the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether he ought in conſcience any longer to keep the places they treated about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> who was not a man to make uſe of the occaſion of conſtraining him to it, and who beſides was not moved with the money which he ſaw not in ready Caſh, returned to <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Conſtable accompanied him thither; whether it was that he knew him ſo well as to confide in him, or that the love of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53255:130"/> his Country at that time prevailed with him over all other conſiderations of policy and convenience. It is not known neither if that frankneſs ſtifled all the remains of averſion that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> might ſtill conceive againſt the Conſtable; or if that which is ſaid of his Majeſty of <hi>Navarre</hi> was true, that he eaſily forgot injuries received when he was perſuaded that thoſe who had done them remembred them no more; but it is certain, that after his return into <hi>Navarre</hi> he lived in ſo good a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Conſtable, that he paſſed from one extremity to the other; and that whereas till then he had been of the Faction of <hi>Grammont;</hi> he entered into that of <hi>Beaumont</hi> which thereby recovered freſh ſtrength. The Queen his Wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting his inconſtancy continued firm in the Party of <hi>Grammont,</hi> but that made nothing the more for her intereſt, ſeeing the Nobility of <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſeeing the Royal Family divided, took Parties alſo; and the People thereby conceived a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt of <hi>John d' Albert</hi> than they had had for the exceſs of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that <hi>Caeſar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> Duke of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> Baſtard Son of Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Sixth, who had <note place="margin">Towards the end of the Life of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:53255:130"/> married the Siſter of <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> having made his eſcape out of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Priſons, came at time into <hi>Navarre,</hi> and made an accommodation betwixt his Brother-in-law and the Queen: That he convinced <hi>John d' Albert</hi> that he had done wrong in abandoning the Faction of <hi>Grammont,</hi> and engaged him in it again: but if that be ſo, the Duke found the leſs reſiſtance in it, that an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wrought in that particular all that he could have promiſed himſelf from his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> ſent an Officer to the Conſtable with an Order from his Majeſty; and the Conſtable pretending that the Officer in the diſcharge of his Commiſſion had not ſhewn him the reſpect which was due to the chief Commander of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, cauſed him to be cudgelled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Priſoner. The action in it ſelf was inſupportable: Nevertheleſs it is probable <hi>John d' Albert</hi> would have ſlighted the affront done him in the perſon of his Officer, or at leaſt that he would not have driven his reſentment ſo far as it went, if the Duke of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> whoſe Crimes God Almighty would no longer bear with, had not offered to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe the inſolence of the Conſtable, and had not obtained permiſſion to do ſo.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53255:131"/> 
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> granted it more out of importunity than the deſire of revenge, and the Duke laid ſiege to the Caſtle of <hi>Viane</hi> which held for the Faction of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> The Conſtable being reſolved to raiſe it, coſt what it would, advanced with his Forces within view of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers; and the Duke before he had reſolved whether he ſhould go out to meet him, or expect him, within his Lines, went out to view them. He met with three Troopers, who killed him, and <hi>John d' Albert</hi> being informed of his death, changed all of a ſudden his inclination. He haſtened to his Army, gave no quarter to thoſe of <hi>Beaumont;</hi> took their Towns and Caſtles; hanged up or put to the Sword thoſe that defended them; burnt their Farm and Country houſes; deſtroyed their Woods; and his anger tranſported him ſo far that in the Town of <hi>Lerin,</hi> which he took by ſtorm, he ruined the ſtately burying-place of the Conſtables Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>The Forces of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> came ſo late to the aſſiſtance of thoſe of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> that the Conſtable after his overthrow found them in their march upon the rode as he fled to <hi>Arragon.</hi> Seeing they were not ſtrong enough to buoy up a forlorn cauſe, he ſent them back, and confined himſelf
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53255:131"/> with his Wife within the Town of <hi>Aranda,</hi> where ſome months after both died of grief. <hi>Louis</hi> of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> their eldeſt Son, went to the Court of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to ſollicite an aſſiſtance capable to reſtore him to the rights of his Family; but he prevailed not until the year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and twelve, when a favourable Juncture of uſurping <hi>Navarre</hi> was offered to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hatred which Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bore againſt the <hi>French</hi> was grown to ſuch a heighth, that being neither able to endure them in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor yet to drive them thence any other way than by the Arms of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>

               </note> his Holineſs acquainted him that he might expect any thing from him, provided he would enter into a League with the <hi>holy See</hi> againſt <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>France. Ferdinand</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he would conſent to it on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Pope cauſed a ſecret Bull of Excommunication to be expeded againſt <hi>John d' Albert</hi> and his Queen, as favourers of <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, the declared enemy of the Church, and that his Holineſs ſent it to his Catholick Majeſty to be made uſe of in time and place as he ſhould judge moſt convenient. The Bull, as it is ſaid,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53255:132"/> was expeded, and was kept ſo ſecret that no man ever ſaw either the Original or a Copy of it. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> received it, or pretended he had, and raiſed a powerful Army, the Command whereof he gave to <hi>Frederick de Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> under pretext of attacking <hi>Guyenne</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> whilſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> his Son-in-law, ſhould make a deſcent in that Province at the mouth of the River of <hi>Garonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> was ſo little apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of being attacked, that he had not ſo much as raiſed one Soldier, though the Maxims of good Government allowed him not to remain diſarmed amidſt all his Neighbours in Arms. He ſuffered the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> to advance within Eight Leagues of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> and never took the alarm till the Catholick King, having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty brought all his Forces into the Centre of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and taken juſt meaſures with the Conſtables Son, and with the remnant of the Faction of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> ſent a Herald to tell the Queen and King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> and all his Adherents were Excommunicated for having called and held a Council in the City of <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> againſt the holy See. That the Pope had given their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to him who could firſt poſſeſs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53255:132"/> them, and that his Catholick Majeſty had confederated with the King of <hi>England</hi> for his ſeizing of <hi>Guienne,</hi> which lay equally convenient for both: that the Engliſh Fleet was to approach thither on the one ſide, at the ſame time when his Catholick Majeſty entered it on the other; and that to the end <hi>Ferdinand</hi> might not fail at the appointed time, there was a neceſſity he ſhould march through <hi>Navarre</hi> with what Baggage and Artillery were needful for him to lay Siege to the City of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> that the ſame paſſage was as neceſſary for his Armies marching back again to his own Territories; and that for ſecuring it in caſe he ſucceeded not in his enterpriſe as he expected, their Majeſties of <hi>Navarre</hi> muſt needs give him the places of <hi>Eſteille, Maye,</hi> and <hi>St. John Pied de Port</hi> for Cautionary Towns: that he promiſed upon his honour if they were freely granted him, to reſtore them again faithfully ſo ſoon as his Forces were come back again into <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon:</hi> but if they were abſolutely refuſed, or not preſently entruſted into his hands, they muſt not take it ill if he endeavoured to put in execution the Bull of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second had juſt then thundered out againſt their Majeſties of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as well as againſt <hi>Louis</hi> the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53255:133"/> Twelfth of <hi>France.</hi> The Queen and King of <hi>Navarre</hi> gave Audience to the Herald in the Town of <hi>Tudelle</hi> where their Eſtates were aſſembled, and made him anſwer, That <hi>Navarre</hi> intended to obſerve an exact Neutrality betwixt the moſt Chriſtian and Catholick Kings; and as the Catholick King might have ground to complain of their Majeſties of <hi>Navarre,</hi> if they permitted the <hi>French</hi> to paſs their Country for invading <hi>Arragon</hi> or <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſo would the moſt Chriſtian King alſo have, if they opened a paſſage through their States for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to enter into <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who only waited for that anſwer, marched ſtreight to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona;</hi> and gave the ſignal to thoſe of the Faction of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who made in one day an Inſurrection in all the other Towns of <hi>Navarre,</hi> in favours of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the two and twentieth of <hi>July</hi> One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and twelve.

            <p>THE <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtorians, treating of the Invaſion of <hi>Navarre,</hi> put it off with a falſe Jeſt. Their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to take their Readers off from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving too narrowly the manner how that Kingdom was united to their Monarchy; by pleaſantly amuſing them whilſt as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as they can they touch ſo nice a point; they ſay, that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> being come to the moſt diſtant place from which he might ſtill ſee his Capital City of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona,</hi> and turning about to take a full view of it, ſell a crying bitterly; and that the Queen <hi>Catharine de Foix</hi> his Wife, offended at ſo unſeaſonable an act of tenderneſs, told him in a diſdainful manner, <note place="margin">In the relation of the flight of <hi>John d' Albert.</hi>
               </note> that he might very well cry like a woman for the loſs of a Crown, which he could not defend like a man. But theſe Authors have not taken
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53255:134"/> notice, That <hi>John d' Albert</hi> and his Queen departed not together from <hi>Pampelona:</hi> That ſeeing the King was more hated there than ſhe, he was the firſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his own ſecurity by flying away about break of day; and that the Queen followed not her Husband till two days after, when he was already entered the Mountains of <hi>Aldude.</hi>

               <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> after the Conqueſt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> had a greater deſire than before to have Children by his ſecond Wife. He was not as yet ſuperannuated; and his failings were only imputed to the diſorders of his youth. The Phyſicians made no doubt but by their Art they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve his former vigour for ſome time at leaſt, and taught the Queen <hi>Germana</hi> how to make a love Potion, which in their opinion would prove infallible. The Queen, who would not venture upon any thing that ſhe might be reproached with, ſpoke of it to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who bid her take the care of preparing it her ſelf, that it might be kept the more ſecret. She only communicated it to her Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in whom ſhe had greateſt confidence, and they preſented it one Evening to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> when he was going to bed at <hi>Carrouſillo</hi> a houſe of pleaſure, where he ſpent the ſpring of the year One thouſand
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53255:135"/> five hundred and thirteen. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> drank up the Potion to the very dregs; but whether the Doſe was too ſtrong for the weakneſs of his Conſtitution, or that it was not carefully enough prepared, it had a quite contrary effect to the intent of thoſe that gave it. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſick upon it; and his Phyſicians, who knew the cauſe of his diſtemper, were at a ſtand as to the cure. They cauſed him to be removed to <hi>Megorada,</hi> where he was ſo long and ſo dangerouſly ſeized with all the ſymptomes that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an approaching end, that <hi>Chievres</hi> thought it time ſeriouſly to mind the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Monarchy of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the poſſeſſion of that of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was perſuaded that his Majeſty would uſe his endeavours to diſappoint the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> and ſettle them upon the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and ſince that was the chief thing which he had propoſed to prevent, he was of the opinion that the Archduke ſhould ſend into <hi>Spain Adrian</hi> his Tutor, who was as yet but Dean of <hi>Louvain.</hi> The pretext of that Voyage was the Marriage which the People of the Low Countries deſired for their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betwixt the Archduke and <hi>Renée</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſecond Daughter of <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France:</hi> but in reality
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53255:135"/> the Dean had an Authentick Power, and many blanks ſigned for taking poſſeſſion of the two Monarchies in caſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ſhould die, and at leaſt to preſerve that of <hi>Caſtile</hi> for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, ſuppoſing <hi>Arragon</hi> ſhould be given by Teſtament to the younger Brother.</p>
            <p>The diſpatches were expeded with all imaginable ſecrecy; but the Catholick King was too miſtruſtful not to ſuſpect the true reaſon of the intended Voyage, and ſeeing what Princes on ſuch occaſions do fancy paſſes in their minds for certain truth, the Catholick King received <hi>Adrian</hi> ſo very ill, and ſo many ways tried his patience, that he tired it out. The Dean for his firſt eſſay had undertaken a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation a little too difficult; and he could not worthily acquit himſelf of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continual attendance at the Court of the Catholick King. In the mean time, his Majeſty, who looked upon him as a Spy, would not permit him to wait upon him any whither: Nay, he would have him to return again to <hi>Flanders</hi> as often as he found himſelf any way better, ſo that he was in a condition of travelling abroad in the Country; which the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took for an abſolute cure. Inſomuch as the Dean having to remain at Court
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53255:136"/> exhauſted all the excuſes that had been ſuggeſted to him in his Inſtructions, found himſelf reduced to ſuch ſtreights as far ſurpaſſed the capacity of a man bred up in the Schools.</p>
            <p>The Courtiers whom he knew to be well affected towards the Archduke, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his trouble by acquainting him from time to time with freſh inſtances of kindneſs which the Catholick King ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Infanto.</hi> They magnified them in their notes; took them for ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of an infallible preference; perſiſted to preſs him that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it; and threatned that if it were not done with all expedition, they would abandon the Party of the Archduke, and ſtrike in with the <hi>Infanto.</hi> In a word, the Dean in the ſhort converſe that he had had with the Catholick King, obſerved that that Prince had an extreme averſion to <hi>Chievres;</hi> that he imputed to him the little Authority which he had in the Low Countries: that he was perſuaded that his Grandſons Governour had hindered him from Reigning there in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he did in <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to revenge himſelf upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, he would do it upon the Pupil: That that was truly the ground of the miſunderſtanding betwixt the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53255:136"/> and Grandſon, and that <hi>Chievres</hi> was the Victim to be ſacrificed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the two: That if he were removed from the Archduke, it was certain that the Catholick King would more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly liſten to Nature, which pleaded with him in favours of the elder of his Grandchildren, that what he ſaid to him ſuited exactly with his Ambition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the Court of <hi>Flanders</hi> continued as it was, that is, in the inflexibility that it had always ſhewn in giving ſatisfaction to the Catholick King; that Prince would compleat what he had begun; and by his laſt Will ſettle the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſo firmly in the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> that it would be impoſſible for the Archduke to diſpoſſeſs him.</p>
            <p>This long train of reaſonings engaged the Dean into a conduct equally contrary to his humour, and to the gratitude which till then he had manifeſted to <hi>Chievres</hi> his Benefactor. He thought at leaſt that the Catholick King ought to be amuſed with the vain hopes of turning out the Archdukes Governour, if he were not fully ſatisfied in the point, and in that proſpect cauſed it to be intimated to his Majeſty, that if he would act joyntly with him, he promiſed himſelf to ſupplant <hi>Chievres,</hi> and to put in his place the man
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53255:137"/> whom his Majeſty ſhould deſign for the employment.</p>
            <p>The Propoſition was ſo acceptable to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the cauſes of the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Chievres</hi> and <hi>Adrian.</hi>
               </note> that he ſent for the Dean to diſcourſe the matter with him hand to hand without Witneſſes. The Dean who was prepared to remove, or at leaſt to leſſen the chief difficulties in the Affair, delivered himſelf after his way, and in Articles to his Majeſty, that <hi>Chievres</hi> was not ſo ſecurely ſetled but that he might be ſhaken; and that <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, who had given him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which he diſcharged, would not live long enough to maintain him in it: That though his Pupil made a ſhew of a great deal of friendſhip for him, that was not abſolutely to be relied upon, ſeeing that young Prince was known already to excel in the art of diſſimulation, and was beſides reſolved not to diſpleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Paternal Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, with whom <hi>Chievres</hi> had always entertained a ſtrict correſpondence: but that at the bottom the Archduke was like other young people, and that there was never any Governour who ſincerely gained the friendſhip of his Pupil when he diſcharged his duty with all ſtrictneſs as <hi>Chievres</hi> had done: That many <hi>Flemiſh</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:53255:140"/> Gentlemen, Heirs of Families, took it impatiently that a younger Brother of the houſe of <hi>Croy</hi> ſhould be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to the Education of their Prince; and that they would not only be well pleaſed at the diſgrace of <hi>Chievres,</hi> but alſo with emulation contribute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>The Deans diſcourſe produced but part of the effect which he promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who had liſtened to him with all the attention of a prejudiced man, to whom an expedient was offered of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which till then he had in vain ſought for, conceived an extraordinary joy at it, yet not without the allays of fear and diffidence. He ſuſpected part of the truth and gueſſed at the Politicks of the Deans conduct. Nay, he thought him an abler Politician than indeed he was; and imagined that his deſign was not only to amuſe him, but alſo to oblige his Prince to whom he had preſerved his birth-right, and <hi>Chievres</hi> whom he had ſerved moſt advantageouſly by cluding the moſt terrible effects of the hatred of the Catholick King, under pretext of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſame.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ferdinand</hi> replied to the Dean, that he heartily accepted the offer he made him: But ſeeing the affair in hand was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53255:141"/> very tickliſh in it ſelf, it had need be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thought of before it was attempted to be put into execution, and that there was no ſucceeding in it unleſs ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were taken as might not eaſily be ſubject to change. That the beſt way would be to put it down in writing by way of a Treaty betwixt his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty and the Archdukes Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, to the end that each of them having an Authentick Copy of it, they might have recourſe to the ſame in all the doubts that might ariſe as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances that they ſhould agree upon.</p>
            <p>The Dean very well perceived the ſnare that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> laid for him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the Writing which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King might give him would oblige him no more than his word, the Dean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither of birth nor condition to force him to the accompliſhment of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had the Deans Writing in his hands, he might make uſe of it when he pleaſed to undo him, by ſhewing that he had without Orders negotiated and concluded the Depoſition of <hi>Chievres.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſince the Dean had propoſed it; and by conſequent that if there were any crime in it, he was the firſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to commit it, he went on, and treated
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53255:139"/> with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to ſupplant <hi>Chievres.</hi> It is unknown whether there was any neglect on the Deans part in not ſending ſpeedy enough advice into <hi>Flanders</hi> of what he had judged convenient to negotiate in <hi>Spain:</hi> whether his Secretary was not faithful to him: whether <hi>Chievres</hi> was not punctually informed by the Intelligences which he entertained at vaſt charges in <hi>Spain</hi> of what was hatching to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; or whether <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick fetch which the Dean had not foreſeen was the Author himſelf of <hi>Chievres</hi> his being acquainted with it, in proſpect of Governing in <hi>Flanders</hi> when he had ſet the two moſt faithful Miniſters of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon one againſt another. But it is certain that <hi>Chievres</hi> was punctually advertiſed from other hands than the Deans, of what he had tranſacted with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to his prejudice, and that thereafter there was no more ſolid friendſhip betwixt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Praeceptor of the Archduke. However their miſunderſtandings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not but in ſuch private occurrences as concerned the profit or ſatisfaction of either of the two; and by the rareſt event that, perhaps, can be found in any Hiſtory it did not the leaſt prejudice to the affairs of their Pupil.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53255:140"/>
            <p>Since it had only hapned by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening application of one of the two, that is of the Tutor to the ſervice of the Archduke, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> reaped not from it all the fruit which he expected; and the countenance which afterward he gave the Dean procured him many friends at Court, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to deſpair of his Catholick Majeſties reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. He recovered notwithſtanding; and ſince he thought it neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive people by feigning to have recovered his former vigour, he often changed his reſidence, and uſed all the other exerciſes of thoſe who are in health. But the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians for all that whiſpered his friends in the ear that his Dropſie was come to a height, and that ſome time or other it would carry him off. <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſo well informed of it that he adviſed the Archduke not to be any longer ſo great a husband of his meaſures with his Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grandfather, but to uſe all neceſſary caution to hinder the effect of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had for the Infanto <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> The moſt important that he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him was taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that all the Sovereigns of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> Leagued together in the Year One thouſand five hundred and fifteen with the Catholick King againſt the new King of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53255:138"/> 
               <hi>France Francis</hi> the Firſt, who ſucceeded to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, with deſign to divert him from recovering the Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> This was the Count of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken in the Firſt Book; and ſeeing till then he had made a profeſſion of friendſhip to the Archduke, it ought not to be interrupted by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Crown of <hi>France. Gouffiers</hi> and <hi>Chievres,</hi> the Governours of thoſe two young Princes, had united them principally in that proſpect; and if <hi>Francis</hi> was concerned to make ſure of not being attacked by the Low Countries whilſt he was employed in <hi>Italy, Charles</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more to be in a perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the <hi>French</hi> when ever the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Spain</hi> came to be open. For if his younger Brother were preferred before him by the laſt Will of the Catholick King; and that he offered to the new moſt Chriſtian King to reſtore <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> provided <hi>France</hi> entred into a League offenſive and defenſive with him againſt his elder Brother, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke would have no other way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing him but by the Ocean Sea, the more unſafe that it was expoſed to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tempeſts; and beſides it would be the more uneaſie to get into <hi>Spain</hi> that way, that all the Ports would be their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53255:139"/> Enemies. If the Archdukes Fleet were diſabled by the Winds, or defeated by Ships of his younger Brother, it would be impoſſible for him to fit it out again, ſeeing the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were not of the humour to be at the charge of another; and if the Forces that he landed were cut in pieces, he would hardly find any others that would venture upon a ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. If the Catholick King left only the Monarchy of <hi>Arragon</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he would keep it in ſpight of his Brother, provided <hi>France</hi> were not againſt him. In fine, if the Infanto were omitted in his Grandfathers Will, and nevertheleſs he did aſpire to the Thrones which had been deſigned for him, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a King by themſelves, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what in them lay to raiſe him to them; and the Archduke would not be in a condition of oppoſing it, unleſs aſſiſted by <hi>France:</hi> whereas by contracting a firm Alliance with that King, thoſe who awakened the Ambition of the Infanto whilſt they exaſperated the Catholick King againſt the Archduke, would refrain from both theſe deſigns when they ſaw no hopes of ſucceeding in them. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King would not prefer a younger Brother before an elder, when he ſaw that his preference would ſerve for no other
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53255:137"/> end than to give occaſion to the elder to oppreſs the younger. The Infanto would ſubmit to the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi> when all hopes of violating them ſecurely were taken from him; and whatever unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident might happen, all the Paternal and Maternal Dominions of the Archduke would be united in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>The Archduke being perſuaded by theſe reaſons, ſent <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Court, and <hi>Chievres</hi> framed his Inſtructions. They conſiſted of three parts with relation to the three principal Affairs which then were to be adjuſted betwixt the Archduke and the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, with this Artifice that the moſt important of the three was put in the laſt place, and appeared only as an acceſſary to the other two: whereas the other two rightly taken were but an acceſſary to the laſt. <hi>Chievres</hi> then repreſented in the firſt place, that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the repoſe of Chriſtendom that the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Archduke to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was betwixt them ſhould add a Bond that might render it indiſſoluble; and that in the Juncture then no ſuch Bond could be but the marriage of the Archduke with <hi>Renée</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſecond Daughter to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53255:138"/> younger Siſter to the moſt Chriſtian Queen. The Count of <hi>Naſſau</hi> was told that the chief buſineſs for which he was ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> was only to make that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and that there ſeemed only two Obſtacles that could thwart it, one ariſing from the Portion of the Princeſs, and the other from her Perſon. As to the firſt, all men knew that <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth had but two Daughters alive by the Heireſs of <hi>Bretagne, Claudia</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Renée;</hi> and that <hi>Claudia</hi> the Eldeſt, whom the Salick Law debarred from the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, carried by birth-right the two <hi>Fiefs,</hi> which were in deed and in pretenſion the Eſtates of their Father and Mother, to which the younger Siſter could lay no claim. The <hi>Fief</hi> effective was <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and the pretended, the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> which <hi>Louis</hi> had loſt three years before his death, and of which <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt was about to attempt the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by going into <hi>Italy</hi> in Perſon with a powerful Army. But that the Royal Family of <hi>Dreux,</hi> which for almoſt three hundred years had poſſeſſed <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and that of <hi>Viſconti,</hi> which had held the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe</hi> as long, had purchaſed fair Eſtates there, with Towns and Caſtles from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral private perſons: That theſe Eſtates ought not to be conſidered as Crown
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53255:144"/> Lands in the ſucceſſion of <hi>Louis</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and that by conſequent <hi>Renée</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ought to come in for a ſhare with the moſt Chriſtian Queen: That upon that account it might happen that <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt would refuſe his Siſter-in-law to the Archduke, <note place="margin">In the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Count of <hi>Naſſau.</hi>
               </note> as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that one day the Archduke might put him to it in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too rigorouſly his ſhare, and in not accepting a valuable conſideration, to the end he might reſerve to himſelf entries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and into <hi>Italy</hi> by the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>France</hi> ſhould reconquer it.</p>
            <p>The Expedient which <hi>Chievres</hi> found for that, and which he inſerted in the Inſtructions, was to anticipate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare beforehand to the Council of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt that the Archduke and Princeſs <hi>Renée</hi> at their Marriage ſhould renounce the Succeſſions of her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a certain Sum of money; and all the circumſpection that was required of the Count was to drive the Sum as high as poſſibly he could, without breaking up the Treaty. The ſecond Obſtacle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that the Princeſs <hi>Renée</hi> was ugly and ill ſhaped; which made him fear that the <hi>French</hi> might take a pretext
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53255:145"/> from thence to condemn her to a ſingle life, for this reaſon that ſhe would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſlighted by him that ſhould marry her. Whereupon the Count of <hi>Naſſau</hi> had Orders to repreſent, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke was early convinced by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, That Sovereigns married not for their private ſatisfaction, but for the good of their Subjects: That he was fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the duties of marriage; That the Princeſs and he were of the ſame age; and ſeeing the qualities of her mind made ſufficient mends for the defects of her body, the Archduke would not fail to love her tenderly, and to uſe her as kindly as if ſhe were a moſt charming beauty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article of the Negotiation related to the reſtitution of <hi>Navarre,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, upon his coming to the Crown had declared that he would have it reſtored to <hi>John d' Albert;</hi> and that if he could not diſpoſe the Catholick King to it, he would break with him upon that conſideration alone. <hi>Chievres</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Naſſau</hi> to wave as much as he could treating of ſo nice a point, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the impoſſibility of ſnatching that Crown out of the hands of his Catholick Majeſty, by any other courſe than that of the Sword; and by adding that the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53255:143"/> Archduke had no hand in that uſurpation, and that it depended no more on him than it did on the moſt Chriſtian King, to reſtore <hi>John d' Albert:</hi> but if the Council of <hi>France</hi> ſtood upon it, and would not treat without that, <hi>Naſſau</hi> having proteſted that his Maſter had no power upon his Maternal Grandfather, which was but too true; ſhould ſay that the Archduke as to that particular could do but two things, and that he offered to the Chriſtian King to do both. The firſt was ſincerely to uſe his intereſt with the Catholick King to diſpoſe him to reſtore <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the next to promiſe faithfully to reſtore it himſelf upon the death of his Maternal Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father.</p>
            <p>The third Article remained which was properly the ſoul of the Negotiation. It related to the aſſiſtance which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke thought needful to him for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſucceſſion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> expreſſed it in the moſt civil and reſerved terms that could be. No mention was made in it, neither of the Catholick Kings deſign of fruſtrating the elder of his Grandchildren of the Monarchies of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> in favours of the younger, nor of the youngers ambitious reſolution by all means to comply with the kindneſs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53255:144"/> that his Grandfather had for him, though he was ſufficiently ſenſible of the injuſtice thereof. It was only expreſſed in general terms, that if, according to the courſe of nature, the Arch-duke out-lived his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Grandfather, and that he ſhould meet with difficulties in obtaining the Succeſſion of that Prince from what hand ſoever they might happen; <hi>France,</hi> who acknowledged the Archduke for next, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, lawful, univerſal, and apparent Heir of the two Monarchies to which the Laws in that caſe called him to reign alone, and in excluſion of all others, ſhould aſſiſt him with Forces and Ships till he were peaceably ſetled in the poſſeſſion of thoſe two Kingdoms, and ſhould in no manner favour his Competitor, even though he, to engage the King of <hi>France</hi> more powerfully to his defence, ſhould offer actually to reſtore <hi>Navarre</hi> to <hi>John d' Albert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Naſſau</hi> acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſo thorny a Commiſſion ſooner and more eaſily than was expected at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> becauſe <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt perſuaded himſelf that nothing could hinder him from recovering the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> provided his Expedition into <hi>Italy</hi> were not diverted by the irrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Flemings</hi> into <hi>Picardy</hi> and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53255:142"/> 
               <hi>Champagne;</hi> and that then it would be at the option of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty either to ſend an Army, or to go in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the reſtauration of <hi>John d' Albert.</hi> In that proſpect he offered <hi>Naſſau</hi> ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns for the Portion of his Siſter-in-law; <note place="margin">In the Treaties betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> the more willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted them, that he would have been content with four hundred thouſand, if the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Du Prat,</hi> and the Commiſſioners who treated with him, had ſtood firm not to give him any more. The ſecond Article was more diſputed, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> were poſitive that the Archduke ſhould promiſe to declare for <hi>John d' Albert</hi> againſt the Catholick King, ſuppoſing he abſolutely ſhould refuſe the reſtitution of <hi>Navarre. Naſſau</hi> on the contrary main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that it was no leſs againſt nature than good manners that a Grandſon ſhould eſpouſe the quarrel of a ſtranger againſt his own Grandfather. <hi>Francis</hi> was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to conclude, that after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates he remitted it; and the third Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was at length decided, his Majeſty reſolving to imitate the example of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, his great great Grandfather, who, without the aſſiſtance of any other Sovereign, had at his pleaſure diſpoſed of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53255:143"/> the Crown of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by the Arms of his Conſtable <hi>Du Gueſclin.</hi> So the Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was ended at <hi>Paris</hi> in the beginning of the Summer One thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen; and <hi>Stephen Poncher,</hi> who had been chief Miniſter of State to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, was ordered to go to <hi>Flanders</hi> to be Witneſs to the Ratification of the Treaty. The Archduke was gone into <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Poncher</hi> found him at the <hi>Hague.</hi> He was received there with more Joy than Pomp: but as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke had Spies at the Court of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, ſo had the Catholick King at his, who diſcovered by means which Hiſtorians diſagree about; that the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was taken off from the Intereſts of his Grandfather; and that he had even called him an Uſurper, by confeſſing that he had unjuſtly ſeized the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and by obliging himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it ſo ſoon as it was in his power. They acquainted the Catholick King with it, who confirmed himſelf in the reſolution that, as we ſaid before, he had already taken of undoing <hi>Chievres;</hi> and fruſtrating the Archduke not only of what he had acquired by Conqueſt, but alſo of what he could pretend to in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:53255:141"/>
            <p>The firſt ſtep he made in his revenge was to put <hi>Navarre</hi> in a condition, that though the Archduke would reſtore it, yet his own Subjects might have right to take him off from it, and to oppoſe the execution of his intentions. For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his Intrigue, we muſt call to mind that the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was much more powerful in <hi>Spain</hi> than <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> was before their union, and that ſince, Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> had enlarged it by joyning thereto the Kingdom of <hi>Granada.</hi> It was more able than <hi>Arragon</hi> to preſerve the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> when once that Kingdom were joyned to it; and that was the only motive that made the Catholick King, who till then had held the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> annexed to the Crown of <hi>Arragon,</hi> change his Conduct, and ſeek ways how he might joyn it to thoſe of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He knew that <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> with conſent of the moſt Chriſtian King, raiſed a great Army in the Provinces of <hi>France</hi> adjoyning the <hi>Pryenees,</hi> for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Crown; and ſeeing he needed an extraordinary ſtrength to reſiſt him, the States of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi> were aſſembled at the ſame time, that under one and the ſame pretext he might raiſe great Contributions in both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</p>

            <p>The Union of <hi>Navarre</hi> was offered to both; and it was offered upon ſo much the better ground, that that Crown on the one ſide bordered upon <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and on the other upon <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſo that it lay equally convenient for both. Seeing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had a deſign to impoſe upon thoſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> he would not go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> where the Eſtates were to aſſemble, but thought it enough to ſend thither the Queen <hi>Germana</hi> in his place. That Princeſs who had the Art of careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and who beſides for better deceiving the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> was her Husbands blind, made great Journeys, and haſtened to <hi>Monçon</hi> where the Eſtates had aſſembled themſelves, the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> having declared that it was there, and not at <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> where according to the priviledges of the Country the Eſtates ought to meet. She gained the two moſt powerful Bodies, which were the Clergy and Nobility: She repreſented to them according to the Inſtructions which ſhe had received from the Catholick King, that <hi>Arragon</hi> was much weaker than <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and that if heretofore it had reſiſted it, there were two ſuch concurrent aſſiſtances of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the caſe, that it would be a tempting of God to truſt to the hopes of their continuance; the one, that all the Kings
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53255:145"/> of <hi>Arragon</hi> to the number of twenty eight, were always more witty and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant than thoſe of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and the next, that the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> could never make War againſt the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> longer than two years at a time; and that at the end of that at fartheſt, they had new Enemies, or new Civil Wars to take them up, which had obliged, or to ſay better, conſtrained them to give peace to the <hi>Arragoneſe:</hi> That <hi>Arragon,</hi> indeed, was at preſent united to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but that it might be again ſeparated from it, and that in that caſe it would again return to its former ſtate: That to prevent <hi>Caſtile</hi> from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it then into a Province, no better courſe could be taken than to joyn <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> to <hi>Arragon,</hi> becauſe that encreaſe would render it ſo equal in ſtrength to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> durſt not any more attempt to ſubject it: That the only means of obliging the Catholick King to that, ſeeing <hi>Navarre</hi> was his Conqueſt, conſiſted in ſupplying him with moneys for the preſerving it this one time only, that is to ſay, during the Campaign One thouſand five hundred and fifteen, becauſe <hi>John d' Albert</hi> could make no other effort but that once; and if he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, <hi>France</hi> being diſcouraged by ſo conſtant a misfortune would no more protect him.</p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:53255:146"/>
            <p>The <hi>Arrogoneſe</hi> being perſuaded by a diſcourſe which carried the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with it that they preſumed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be better beloved of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King than the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> by reaſon he was their Country man born, and their Hereditary King, willingly taxed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and furniſhed a vaſt Sum of Money conſidering the barrenneſs of their Country. So that Queen <hi>Germana</hi> would have acquired a great deal of glory by her Negotiation, had it not been for an adventure from which perſons of her quality might ſeem to be exempted. <hi>Anthony Auguſtine</hi> of <hi>Arragonian</hi> extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but born in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> had through his merit raiſed himſelf to the dignity of Vicechancellour of <hi>Arragon</hi> according to moſt Hiſtorians, or of Chancellour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others. His Faction and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal was then ſtrongeſt in the States, and if one was not ſure to obtain by his means what was deſired, it was certain at leaſt there was nothing at all to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained if he oppoſed it. The Queen, who knew this very well, made it her particular care to gain him; and ſucceeded therein beyond what ſhe expected, ſeeing ſhe made the Chancellour in love only by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to encreaſe his zeal for his Maſters ſervice.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:53255:146"/>
            <p>Princeſſes have this unhappineſs as well as other of their Sex that are inferiour to them, that they cannot always captivate thoſe whom they would, and catch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe whom they would not. The Queen was ſo free in her ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities to the Chancellour; <note place="margin">In the Hiſtory of that Chancellour.</note> and the Chancellour ſo well diſpoſed to love the Queen; that he was not aware of the Trap when his paſſion already bordered upon extravagance. And the truth is, inſtead of ſtriving againſt it, he applauded himſelf therein, and valued himſelf moſt when he ought to have reckoned himſelf a fool. He flattered himſelf with the hopes of a ſucceſs which he had neither ground nor occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf; and fell into the extremity of doting, by fancying that the Queen would be overjoyed to cheriſh the flame which ſhe had kindled: That the Intereſt of that Princeſs concurred in a very nice point with the paſſion which ſhe had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: That ſhe had no Children, and that there was a neceſſity that by all means ſhe ſhould: That it was but too apparent that ſhe could have none by her Husband: but that if ſhe had ſo much modeſty as not to court the help of another, perhaps ſhe would not have enough to refuſe it when freely offered: That there were
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53255:147"/> ſome Junctures wherein if neceſſity leſſened not the Crime, yet it ſerved to render it more excuſable; and that the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> would not much care how they came by a Prince, provided they had one; becauſe whoever he ſhould be, he would ſerve their ends in dividing them from the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> with whom they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to beunited, and give them a Maſter that would far more depend upon them, than they upon him.</p>
            <p>It is the blind ſide of love to believe the things which one deſires, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo incredible, as firmly as thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are moſt convinced. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour obſerved no meaſures in declaring his paſſion to the Queen; and her Majeſty though thereby provoked to the higheſt degree, yet durſt not treat him as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. She conſidered that her honour was concerned in managing dextrouſly ſo nice an affair, and that though the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal could never be ſufficiently puniſhed for the fault he had committed, yet the rebound of the puniſhment inflicted, if it were not kept very ſecret, would infallibly hit the perſon offended. In that proſpect ſhe thought it enough to let the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour know immediately, and without being perceived, the juſt reſentment ſhe received of his impudence, and in all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53255:147"/> things elſe carried fair with him ſo long as the States of <hi>Monçon</hi> laſted: but after they were ended, ſhe returned to the Catholick King her Husband, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of the folly of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The King commended the Queen no leſs for her Prudence than her Loyalty. He waited for another opportunity of revenging himſelf upon that Miniſter; and cauſed his Conduct to be ſo narrowly obſerved, that ſome miſdemeanours were found againſt him, which yet reached not his life. Upon the account of thoſe he was arreſted without violating the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and clapt up in Priſon, where he lay ſo long as <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> lived, and Queen <hi>Germana</hi> was in authority.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ended not ſo quickly as thoſe of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King had got what he expected from theſe; when he propoſed to the others what he really deſigned to do for them. He ſpake big to them of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and declared that he had taken all that pains for them: He offered to them, without any condition, to unite that Crown to their Monarchy; and having gained them by a Preſent of that importance, conjured them to aſſiſt him in the preſervation of it. Hereupon
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53255:148"/> 
               <hi>Navarre</hi> was in due form incorporated with <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Eſtates gave the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King thrice as much as he had received from thoſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and that liberality ſerved him for an excuſe to his Hereditary Subjects for his breach of promiſe to them. He ſent them word, that what they had granted him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to defray the charges of the defence of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to accept the offers of the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the condition they had impoſed upon him: That he had, indeed, united <hi>Navarre</hi> to their Monarchy, but that he had done nothing in that but what his Councils of Conſcience and State had adviſed him to: That his Counſel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had determined, that ſince the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> was conquered by a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> General the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> by an Army almoſt all native <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and by the Money which had been contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by the States of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty could not, without an evident piece of injuſtice to them, refuſe to unite to their Monarchy a Conqueſt made at their charges: That his Council of State had ſeſolved the ſame; though upon another Principle: That he foreſaw that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> finding himſelf too weak for recovering the Crown of his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53255:148"/> Queen, would in deſpair be obliged to make over to <hi>France</hi> the Rights that he had to it; and that in that caſe <hi>France</hi> having none to make head againſt it but the little Monarchy of <hi>Arragon,</hi> would very eaſily ſnatch <hi>Navarre</hi> from them: whereas the moſt Chriſtian Kings would find incomparably a harder labour of it, if they muſt fight a King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> whoſe Dominions were as large as their own, ſince they comprehended two thirds of all <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be believed, that the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> were not ſatisfied with that off-come, and that they were not willing ſo to be paid for the ready money which he had filily drawn out of their Purſes by the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offer of an imaginary promotion to Grandeur. But their reſentment came not to the height of an Inſurrection; and that which ſtopt their ſliding into ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery a Precipice, was the reparation for the injury done unto them, that they expected from the Succeſſour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, perceiving him now drawing towards his end. We cannot but mention briefly in this place for the full clearing of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, <note place="margin">In the firſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goneſe</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</note> though the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which we are about to deſcribe concern it but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53255:149"/> indirectly, that the Army raiſed by <hi>John d' Albert</hi> for the recovery of <hi>Navarre,</hi> had no ſucceſs but in the beginning of Action: that is was afterwards unfortunate; that being unluckily divided, the Forces of the Catholick King beat part of it; that the reſt periſhed by Famine; that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> died for grief upon it; and that <hi>Catharine de Foix</hi> his Wife out-lived him but a few months; that their Succeſſion deſcended upon the eldeſt Son of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Children which they had, who was not then of age to carry Arms, and that in this world the good fortune of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King in his uſurpations laſted as long as his life.</p>
            <p>The ſubmiſſion that he found in <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> inhabited by a people moſt jealous of their Priviledges, on an occaſion whereon no inſtance could be ſhewn that they would have ſuffered any ſuch thing from the Kings his Predeceſſors, fully perſuaded him that he would meet with no oppoſition when he ſhould demand of the <hi>Arragoneſe,</hi> that they would prefer the younger of his Grandſons before the Elder; and that then the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> would imitate their example in that particular, with ſo much the more facility, that it was no new thing to them, and that their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory afforded an inſtance of a like ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53255:149"/> of the of the order of nature. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, on the fifteenth of <hi>June</hi> One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and fifteen made an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Teſtament after his own way, and couched it ſo artfully, that his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein appeared exactly conform to the Precepts of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>In the beginning he premiſed that his affection for the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> whom he had governed two and forty years, overſwayed with him all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſiderations; and he took God to witneſs that what he was about to do, proceeded ſolely from that Principle: He added, that he had never ſeen the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke <hi>Charles;</hi> and that on the contrary, the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> could not be better known to him than he was: that he was born in his Palace; that he was his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; had given him his name; bred him; placed about him ſuch perſons as would take care of his Education; and that above all things that could endear the Infanto to him, he was his own Picture, and much more reſembled him than any of the Children whom he had immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten: That he had his Air, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Shape, Humours, and even his Gate; and that all Courtiers obſerved his Genius to be the very ſame: but that nevertheleſs nothing of all that inclined
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53255:150"/> him to prefer him before the Archduke That he had three ſuch prevalent reaſons for it, as he was willing to make publick; to the end unprejudiced Poſterity might judge of his conduct. The firſt was, becauſe his Catholick Majeſty had always been croſſed in the care that he would have taken of the Archduke, and thence it was that that young Prince was not fit to govern the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That in ſpight of him they had ſet over him <hi>Chievres</hi> a <hi>Fleming,</hi> who not only was unacquainted with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> manners, but beſides, had a fearful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to them: That this Governour had made it his whole deſign to get ſo abſolute a ſway over the Genius of his Pupil, that he was become all at once, his Governour, Chamberlain, High Steward, and Favourite: That if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke Reigned in <hi>Spain,</hi> that Gentleman alone would make up his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſtranger, which never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſince the uſurpation of the <hi>Moors:</hi> That their Laws and Cuſtoms would be changed, their Priviledges aboliſhed, their Magiſtracies ſold, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the <hi>Indies</hi> tranſported to the Low Countries.</p>
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53255:150"/>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon was taken from hence, <note place="margin">In the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </note> That if <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> had ſtood in need of a reſident King whilſt theſe two Monarchies were divided, they had much more need of one ſince their Union; and there was no doubt to be made but that the abſence of their Monarch would cauſe Revolutions amongſt them, ſeeing it was a certain truth that they never failed to ſuffer Commotions that ſhook the very Foundations, when their Sovereigns were in the leaſt abſent. Nevertheleſs nothing was more certain than that the Archduke would neither live always, nor yet long at a time in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuppoſing he were their King: That it would be unjuſt, and indeed fooliſh to expect it: That he poſſeſſed the Low Countries which lay too conveniently for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> not to be uſurped by one of thoſe two Monarchies, if their Maſter budged from thence; and beſides, he was in <hi>Germany</hi> to ſucceed to the ten Hereditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which would no leſs abſolutely require his preſence: whereas the Infanto his Brother, who was to have no more but the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> would live ſix months of the year in one, and the other ſix months in the other.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:53255:151"/>
            <p>In fine, the third reaſon alledged, That it would be a greater prejudice to the Archduke to leave him the Monarchies of <hi>Spain</hi> than to fruſtrate him of them, ſeeing in the firſt caſe the <hi>Germans</hi> would be ſure not to chuſe him Emperour in place of his Paternal Grandfather, and would ground his Excluſion upon their fear, leſt being otherwiſe ſo powerful he might attempt the changing of their <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical</hi> State into an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as it hapned to all thoſe Nations who had choſen Sovereigns that were able to ſubject them; whereas the Archduke having no more but the Low Countries, and the ten Hereditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> though he was more powerful than any Prince of <hi>Germany</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſeparately, yet he would not be near ſo ſtrong as all of them together; and by conſequent durſt not moleſt any of them, for fear they might all League againſt him, depoſe him, and having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Empire among themſelves, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him of his Hereditary States.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Catholick King diſpoſed of the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> by the chief Article of his Will, in the ſame manner as if they had both equally belonged unto him. He left them purely and ſimply to the Infanto
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53255:151"/> 
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Grandſon after the death of the Queen his Mother. He ſuppoſed that the Diſtemper of that Princeſs would laſt as long as ſhe lived; and would have the Archduke to reſt ſatisfied with the Succeſſion of his Father, of which he was fully in poſſeſſion, and that of his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grand-father which he would not miſs of; as if it had been in the power of his Catholick Majeſty to make a lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of inheritances that did not at all belong to him, with theſe whereof he was but proprietor in part.</p>
            <p>The Teſtament was not kept ſecret, whether the Catholick King ſought for an opportunity of revenging himſelf upon his elder Grandſon and his Governor, by the trouble it might give them, or that he did not ſo much ſtand in awe of them as to conceal what he had done to their prejudice. The Infanto <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Servants, the Councils of State of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> knew it, and the news of it was ſoon brought into <hi>Flanders.</hi> All the Archdukes comfort was, that by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> he might recover what was unjuſtly given away from him; and <hi>Chievres</hi> had not leiſure to make all the Reflections which ſo extraordinary a Caſe deſerved, becauſe he was obliged to make it his buſineſs to break the moſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53255:152"/> dangerous Conſpiracy that ever was hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the favour of a man of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>It is not known whether the Catholick King lookt upon him as the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> could have, or that he judged it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to turn him out, not only of place but of life alſo, to the end that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Will might be punctually accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But it is certain that no meaſures that could be taken were omitted to oblige the Arch-Duke to put away his Governor, or for undoing the ſame Governor, in caſe his Pupil were obſtinate in keeping him about his Perſon. The manner how this was ſet about deſerves to be particularly mentioned, were it for no other end but to obſerve the degrees by which the malice of Man advances to the greateſt of Crimes, when once it comes to deceive it ſelf under a cloak and pretext of Devotion. It was impoſſible to reach <hi>Chievres</hi> by the way of Law and Juſtice, becauſe his integrity that was known to all men ſecured him from any ſuch attempt; though after a frequent and moſt critical examination of all that had been acted in the Low-Countries wherein he was concerned, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was taken of the Ceremony which the Arch-Duke by the advice of his Governor
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53255:152"/> had eſtabliſhed in admitting new Knights into the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Laws of Inſtitution of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der approved by the Holy See, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Knights ſhould be choſen out of the Nobleſt Families; and it was pretended that <hi>Chievres</hi> had contravened this, by propoſing to the Arch-Duke in the laſt Chapter that was held for making of Knights, ſome whoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was not ſufficiently made out. <note place="margin">In the conſtitutions of the Order of the Golden Fleece.</note> It could not be denied but that thoſe Men were of greater merit than the others who had been excluded, becauſe it was ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a thing that it would have ſerved to confound the Enemies of <hi>Chievres;</hi> but the words of the Inſtitution muſt exactly be ſtuck to, and it was maintained that <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> was guilty in not having exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them.</p>
            <p>Upon this, theſe Caſes of Conſcience were propoſed to ſeveral Divines of <hi>Spain:</hi> Whether <hi>Chievres</hi> by diſpoſing his Pupil to give the Order to ſuch kind of Perſons had not mortally ſinned againſt God: Whether there were not three different ſorts of Injuſtice in the ſin he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; firſt, in regard of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who is jealous that the Ordinances authoriſed by his Church ſhould be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53255:153"/> obſerved; ſecondly, againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> of which the moſt important Statute was violated; and laſtly, againſt the Nobles of <hi>Flanders</hi> accuſtomed to draw the chief proofs of their Nobility from thoſe of their Anceſtors who had had the honour to receive the Order of the <hi>Fleece:</hi> Whether <hi>Chievres</hi> was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make reſtitution of the Salaries paid to thoſe undeſerving Knights; and laſtly, whether he was not an accomplice in the falſe proofs of Nobility which they had produced before they were received into the Order.</p>
            <p>The Divines decided all the Caſes to the diſadvantage of <hi>Chievres,</hi> and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions were immediately ſent into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to the Ambaſſador of the Catholick King, who ſhewing them to the Archduke preſſed him on the part of his maternal Grandfather, that he would at leaſt ſend the guilty perſon home to his houſe ſeated in the Province of <hi>Haynauld,</hi> if the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which he had rendred him protected him from being puniſhed in a more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary manner. The Archduke inſtead of having any reſpect to the Propoſition of the Ambaſſador and the authority of the Caſuiſts that back'd it, defended his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor upon the ſpot by two reaſons; firſt, that if there had been any fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53255:153"/> in the creation in queſtion, he was as much to be blamed as <hi>Chievres,</hi> ſeeing they had examined the proofs together; and that if they had been ſurpriſed in it, the ſurprize was no leſs common to both: Secondly, that though <hi>Chievres</hi> were more guilty than he, yet it followed not that he ought to be baniſhed the Court, and that a little miſtake ſhould make him forget the long and indefatigable pains of his Education. The Catholick King, who managed the whole Intrigue, though he acted only by ſuch inſtruments as ſeemed to have no concerns with him, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful in his firſt eſſay, changed Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and applied himſelf to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England</hi> his Son-in-law. He repreſented to him that the greateſt intereſt of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Majeſty conſiſted in oppoſing by all means the Alliances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Flemings:</hi> That the wiſeſt of his Predeceſſors had laid down that maxim as a fundamental in their Politicks: That they found the advantage of it ſo long as they practiſed the ſame, and that on the contrary, they loſt all for having neglected it: That the late King, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh had exactly obſerved it in the beginning and towards the middle of his Reign; but that he had omitted it towards the end, when old age and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53255:154"/> infirmities it had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, had rendred him unable to apply himſelf long to buſineſs: that nevertheleſs that was the Juncture when he ought to have eluded the Article of the laſt Will and Teſtament of <hi>Philip of Auſtria</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Louis XII.</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to take the care of the education of his eldeſt Son: That his Majeſty had oppoſed it with all his might becauſe he foreſaw the dangerous conſequences thereof, but that he could not prevail for want of the aſſiſtance of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> That the moſt Chriſtian King had placed <hi>Chievres</hi> about the Archduke; and that <hi>Chievres</hi> being in that nature obliged to <hi>France,</hi> ſtrove to ſhew himſelf but too grateful: That it was not enough for him to adjuſt all the affairs of the Archduke to the Intereſts of <hi>Louis</hi> his Benefactor ſo long as that Prince lived, but that after his death he had continued the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in regard of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: That the Treaty of Marriage of the Archduke with <hi>Renée</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was an undeniable proof of it: That there was no doubt to be made but that that Marriage would be accompliſhed, and that by conſequence <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> would act joyntly ſo long as <hi>Chievres</hi> were about the Archduke: That his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty had made it his buſineſs
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53255:154"/> to oblige the Archduke to remove him, and that there wanted only the Offices of the King of <hi>England</hi> for ſucceeding in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, with extreme trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble underſtood that <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, for his firſt Eſſay had recovered the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> He imputed the eaſineſs of that young Prince's Succeſs to his having employed all the Forces of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> without being obliged to leave Troops for the Guard of his Frontiers of <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Champaigne.</hi> The laſt Negotiation of <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was, in his Judgment, the cauſe of it, and the Marriage of the Archduke with the Siſter-in-law of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, was like ſo to ſecure him in his Conqueſt, that neither <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> nor <hi>Italy</hi> could ſnatch it out of his hands.</p>
            <p>Theſe four conſiderations inclined his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> to ſend to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, and to repreſent to him by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador which he had at his Court, that ſeeing he had more wit for his age than any Prince mentioned in Hiſtory ever had had, and that he was already capable of Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone by himſelf, it was not only uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but alſo diſgraceful to him to retain at his Court ſuch a man as <hi>Chievres,</hi> who ſo long as he continued there would ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe his Reputation: That Politicians
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53255:155"/> who could not call to mind that ever they had ſeen or read of a Prince that at the age of fifteen years, had more prudence, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of wit, addreſs, and experience than the eldeſt Monarchs of <hi>Europe</hi> had, would never believe that the Judicious Councils taken in <hi>Flanders</hi> about the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt matters of State, came immediately from him: That they would always ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Chievres</hi> to be the Author of them; that he ſuggeſted them; found out proper expedients for putting them in execution; and that being now ſatisfied with the glory which he had already acquired in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Low-Countries during the non-age of the Archduke with ſo great wiſdom that the <hi>Flemings</hi> had found no effects of the minority of their Prince, he acted like a compleat Courtier in endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by times a high Reputation to his young Maſter by attributing to him all the projects and important reſolutions that came from himſelf: whereas, if <hi>Chievres</hi> were conſined to his Houſe in <hi>Haynauld</hi> whereof he carried the name, there to ſpend the reſt of his days in quietneſs; or if it were thought fitter to ſend him to the Emperors Court there to manage the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes for the future Election of his Pupil to the Empire, Men would do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the Archdukes merit, and nothing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53255:155"/> would hereafter hinder the People from admiring him as he deſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth added that he was his Neighbour, and more, his Uncle; and that in both theſe reſpects he could not endure that <hi>Chievres</hi> ſhould continue at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles:</hi> That that <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> to ſay no worſe of him, was too much <hi>French;</hi> and that as thereby he was become ſuſpected to <hi>England,</hi> ſo <hi>Spain</hi> would leſs ſuffer him to remain the chief Miniſter and Favourite of him whom they looked upon as next apparent Heir of almoſt all their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The Archduke made anſwer to theſe ſo urgent reaſons, that the faireſt reputation he could acquire was that of being grateful, and that he neither ought, nor would be thought ſo, if he were not ſo in reality: That he could not tell whether he was more obliged to thoſe who had given him life than he was to <hi>Monſieur de Chievres</hi> who had brought him up, and that it would not vex him if he continued all his life-time in that doubt: but that he knew very well that there was no man living to whom he had more diſintereſted obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that he ſhould be guilty of the blackeſt ingratitude, if he made it not known in the world, not only by words and declarations, but in effect and deeds:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53255:156"/> That the leaſt of theſe effects was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not to undertake any important Affair without acquainting him with it; and that he was willing his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> ſhould know that he was ſo punctual in concealing nothing from his Governour, that he had ſhewed him the Letter which he had received from him: That he knew <hi>Monſieur de Chievres</hi> ſo well, that he would anſwer for him, that he was no more Frenchified than he had reaſon for; and that after all, God had been ſo gracious to him as to make him a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: That he was free to admit of ſuch perſons into his Council as he thought capable: That his Neighbours had no right to take exceptions at that, provided he did them no injuſtice in the caſe; and that his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> had far leſs than the reſt, ſince he acknowledged in his Letter that <hi>Monſieur de Chievres</hi> was a man of parts and honeſty notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he ſubjoyned to his prejudice; That he had rather believe the beſt than the worſt; and that the eſteem which he had for his Majeſty was concerned that he ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſo much afflicts thoſe who are extraordinarily ſenſible, as Kings for moſt part are, than when they ſee that their firm reſolutions of ruining the fortune
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53255:156"/> of a Favourite, encreaſed inſtead of leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame. The Archdukes anſwer to <hi>Henry</hi> was conceived in ſuch terms as made it ſufficiently apparent that nothing was to be got by perſiſting to preſs him to remove <hi>Chievres;</hi> and they who examined it were ſo well convinced of that, that their hatred to him tranſported them to the utmoſt extremity. They reſolved by all means to diſpatch him; and ſeeing the extraordinary care that the Archduke took of his Governour from the time of the Letter we have been ſpeaking of, put him without all danger of being aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, they had recourſe to the way of Poyſon. Diligent ſearch was made in <hi>Flanders</hi> for thoſe who were diſcontented at <hi>Chievres,</hi> and ſeeing it was difficult conſidering the place he held, but that a great many thought they had reaſon to complain of him, becauſe, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, the Archduke took pleaſure to beſtow the chief Charges and richeſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices upon the Relations of his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour without being ſollicited by him, there was a Conſpiracy formed to poyſon him. All meaſures for that end were taken; and the day appointed for putting it in execution drew nigh, when God, who ſuffers not always innocence to be oppreſs'd, were it only that perſons but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53255:157"/> of ordinary virtue ſhould not be too much ſcandalized, permitted <hi>Chievres</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the miſchief that was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for him. He acquainted the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke with it, but in ſo unconcerned a manner as if he had not ſpoken in his own Cauſe. He told him that he had bad news to inform him of, and that he would not do it but upon condition that he ſhould ſhew no more reſentment of it than if he were ignorant of the ſame, or as if it did not at all concern him: That there were ſome crimes that out of a principle of Policy ought to paſs unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and that as God did not always puniſh the moſt enormous faults here in this world, ſo neither did he ſometimes take it ill that Sovereigns ſhould refer the puniſhment of them to him who would not fail to do exemplary Juſtice in the other world: That the Poyſoning in queſtion was one of theſe; and that it ought of neceſſity be winked at, ſeeing it muſt have been diſſembled if it had taken effect: That the enquiry made into it muſt either be exact, or but ſuperficial; if it were exact, it would be to no purpoſe on the one hand, becauſe the quality of the parties guilty would of it ſelf exempt them from all ſorts of Proceſs; and on the other hand it would
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53255:157"/> do infinite prejudice both to the Archduke who might pretend to be offended at an unſeaſonable time, and to his Governour who would be expoſed to a ſecond attempt better concerted, and by conſequent more inevitable than the former. If the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry were but ſuperficial, it would ſtill exaſperate the Poyſoners as much, and be no leſs inconvenient for him who had eſcaped their rage: That in an indictment and trial wherein the Publick was ſo much concerned, informations and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings would go too far, and inſenſibly paſs from the Actors to the Authors: That perhaps, theſe might be found to be ſo nearly related to the Archduke, that the diſgrace inconſiderately put upon them would reflect upon himſelf; and that in a word, there was nothing to be done but to have a care for the future of the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; that is to ſay, to be ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and circumſpect that if he muſt needs ſtill fall, it might be by ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable fate as humane prudence could not prevent.</p>
            <p>The Archduke more out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance than inclination followed the counſel of his Governour: but though the matter was not brought to a trial, yet it broke forth, and was ſo well known, that the Hiſtorians of <hi>Spain</hi> have not dared to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53255:158"/> ſmother it, though they ſpeak of it in moſt general, and conſequently moſt inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant terms. The rebound of ſo great a miſchief nevertheleſs muſt needs hit the weaker Party, and it was the misfortune of <hi>Chievres</hi> to be in that caſe at that time. The Catholick King uncertain whom to be revenged on becauſe <hi>Chievres</hi> was not baniſhed, made Dean <hi>Adrian</hi> ſmart for it, whether it was that he ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of having thwarted his deſign, or that he accuſed him of not having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded it with the credit which he had acquired at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> He confined him to <hi>Guadalupa,</hi> where he hoped that his abode would be ſo uneaſie as to make him deſirous of returning home to the Low Countries; but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did not foreſee that his own life would be too ſhort to tire out the Deans pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He had deſired heretofore his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope to be caſt, and God who puniſhes Sovereigns that are addicted to Judicial Aſtrology more ſeverely and univerſally than private perſons, either becauſe he is more Jealous upon their account for the attribute which according to Scripture raiſes him higheſt above them, I mean the knowledge of things to come, or that the ſcandal they give in that particular is more inſupportable to him, deferred not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53255:158"/> the puniſhment of it till the next World. He began it in this, by blinding the underſtanding of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and permitting the Aſtrologers to tell him part of the truth. They aſſured him that he ſhould die at <hi>Madrigal,</hi> and that Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſeemed not at all equivocal, was by his Majeſty interpreted in the moſt natural ſenſe. He thought it ought to be underſtood of the Town of <hi>Madrigal</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> upon ſo much the better ground that there was no other Town of that name in all <hi>Spain.</hi> This put ſuch fancies in his head, that he thought he ſhould not die but when he had a mind to it, and to expreſs it plainly in his own meaning, that he ſhould live till he were weary of life. One of his Courtiers had confirmed him in that opinion, by telling him that he had viſited a Lady in the City of <hi>Avila,</hi> whom the Publick had Sainted in her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and who in <hi>Spain</hi> was honoured as the Saints in heaven: That he had had the happineſs of a quarter of an hours diſcourſe with her, and that he had not failed to recommend the Catholick King to her Prayers: That the holy woman had anſwered him, that his Majeſty ſhould not die till he had conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that ſhe had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to keep that revelation ſecret.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53255:159"/> There needed no more for taking off <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> from ſeriouſly thinking on his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end; and to compleat his blindneſs, that which ought to have excited him to it, ſerved only to divert him from the ſame. After the drinking of the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potion we mentioned, he had been often taken with ſuch terrible fits, that the Phyſicians thought he was ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Nevertheleſs he came to himſelf again ſo well, that next day after he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf in Affairs of State as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. He thereupon fancied that the fainting fits that now and then ſeized him, would be of no dangerous conſequence; and when Father <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Matience,</hi> a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> his Confeſſour came to attend him on Holy days, he asked him if he had any Memoires to communicate to him; and no ſooner had the Confeſſour anſwered no, but that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> preſently diſmiſſed him. Being thus prepoſſeſſed he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the beſt Commandery of the Knights of <hi>Callatrava</hi> was vacant by the death of <hi>Guttierez</hi> of <hi>Padilla,</hi> and reſolved immediately to confer it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> lawful Son to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son. He could not do it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſtitutions without calling
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53255:159"/> the Chapter in that ſole proſpect upon the place, <note place="margin">In the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Order of <hi>Callatrava.</hi>
               </note> and therefore he ſet out upon his Journey thither. But about the end of the month of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> One thouſand five hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, when he was come to the Hamlet of <hi>Madrigalejo,</hi> through which he muſt of neceſſity paſs unleſs he went a great way about, his diſſentery grew ſo great, that it was impoſſible for him to proceed any further. That Hamlet, the leaſt in all <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtood within the Precincts of the Town of <hi>Trugillo;</hi> and that was all which rendered it conſiderable. <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> was no ſooner informed of the name of it, but that he found his miſtake in the interpretation he put upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope, and that he had in vain with ſo much care ſhunned to go to the great <hi>Madrigal,</hi> ſince he muſt end his days in the little one, <hi>Madrigalejo</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue being a diminutive of <hi>Madrigal.</hi> He ſent for the knowing men of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; enquired of them whether that Hamlet where he was had not always gone by the ſame name ſince <hi>Caſtile</hi> was delivered from the Tyranny of the <hi>Moors;</hi> and when they had made him anſwer that it had never changed name; and that it was ſo inconſiderable that no
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53255:160"/> man durſt venture to put it into the Map, he told them, then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is gone.</p>
            <p>He ſent for his Confeſſor, and diſcourſed him in good earneſt about the affairs of his conſcience, and having ordered them, he called for three of his ancienteſt and ableſt Counſellours of State, who were the Licentiat <hi>Zapata,</hi> Doctor <hi>Carvaial,</hi> and the Treaſurer <hi>Vargas.</hi> He asked them what he had more to do for the good of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and told them that they might ſpeak with all freedom. Theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſo aged that they could have no intereſt in the affairs that might happen after the death of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> They expected not to out-live him long, and therefore his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour was a thing indifferent to them. They had no cauſe to fear any change in their fortune, becauſe they knew that the beginnings of the moſt ſevere Reigns were always eaſie; and they expected to die in the beginning. Beſides, they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that which ſoever of the two Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Catholick King ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to him, he would not turn them out of his Council; ſeeing if it were the Archduke, he could not for a long time do it becauſe of his abſence; and if it were the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he could leſs do it by reaſon of his minority. Nothing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53255:160"/> then ſwayed with them but the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which in latter Ages had been ſo abſolutely predominant, and is ſtill ſo predominant in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that hardly does Hiſtory mention one who hath been free from it. And that is ſo violent a love for their Monarchy, that it always prevails with them over the moſt natural and juſt conſiderations; which is of ſo vaſt an extent that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole Earth; ſo conſtant, that it encreaſes rather than is diminiſhed by bad ſucceſs; and ſo nice and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical that it makes always a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the Monarchy and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and never confounds the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for the ſecond with the intereſts of the firſt. The Catholick King during the two and forty years that he had Reigned, had ſo accuſtomed thoſe whom he admitted into his Councils to lay down the univerſal Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> for the ground of all their deliberations, that the three Miniſters whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted agreed in this ſentiment that now was the Juncture when <hi>Spain</hi> was to Reign all over <hi>Europe;</hi> and that if the opportunity was not then nicked what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might happen, perhaps it would never offer again. That we may more clearly expreſs their thoughts, they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53255:161"/> ſuppoſed, that if the Archduke ſhould to the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> unite the Low Countries, the Empire, and the Hereditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> it would be his own fault if he conquered not the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> would make but a weak reſiſtance: whereas if the States, to which the Archduke ought to ſucceed, were divided, and if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of the Catholick King which continued him to the Inheritance of his Father and Paternal Grandfather held good in that particular: If the Infanto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had <hi>Spain,</hi> and if by that means variance entred into the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> not only the greatneſs of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> would be at a ſtand, but alſo it would loſe all that it held in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Neighbourhood. It was only then in that proſpect, and without any reſpect to the Archduke and his perſonal qualities, that <hi>Zapata, Carvaial,</hi> and <hi>Vargas,</hi> declared in his Favours, and the advantage he reaped from it is no leſs ſingular for the cauſes of it than it is in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The three Miniſters repreſented to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> that ſeeing his Majeſty thought fit that they ſhould continue to ſpeak to him
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53255:161"/> with open heart as they had been wont to do, He would ſtill have the goodneſs to take in good part the liberty they took to tell him that he ſeemed to have changed his Conduct at the end of his life, and by his laſt Will and Teſtament condemned his moſt conſiderable Actions, and which had acquired him greateſt Reputation: That he had done them the honour to declare when he called them to his Council, that his only intention in this World was the enlargement of his Territories; and that though he had not expreſſed himſelf ſo plainly, yet there needed no more but to ſtudy his paſt life to convince them of it: That no Man in <hi>Europe</hi> was ignorant how <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick at the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years had eſpouſed the Party of the late Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>Caſtile</hi> againſt the Infanta <hi>Jane</hi> the Daughter of that King; in no other view but becauſe <hi>Iſabella</hi> by beſtowing herſelf upn him, had offered to unite the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and that if <hi>Jane</hi> had been ſo well adviſed as to have preferred his Alliance before that of the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> who ſought her in Marriage, her Party would not have ſuccumbed, and ſhe had not paſt for a Baſtard: That after the union of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> for adding the Kingdom of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53255:162"/> 
               <hi>Granada</hi> to them, Diviſion had been ſown betwixt him who was King of it and his brother; and the more powerful was ſo weakned by ſupporting the weaker againſt him, that both at length were oppreſſed: That for an acceſſion alſo to <hi>Arragon</hi> by joyning thereto the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the City of <hi>Tarento</hi> the Prince who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the name of it, and who was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son of the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was Beſieged: That he had been prevailed with to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon the Faith and Truth of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> whoſe General the <hi>Great Captain</hi> had ſworn to him upon the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to leave him in liberty; and that notwithſtanding he had been detained Priſoner, and under a ſure Guard ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> where ſtill he remained in Priſon: That, in a word, a pretended Bull from the Pope had been made uſe of for ſeizing the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and for driving from thence <hi>John d' Albert</hi> who had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Heireſs of it: In the mean time his Catholick Majeſty deſtroyed his own work by preferring the younger of his Grandſons before the elder, and laid an everlaſting impediment to the greatneſs that <hi>Spain</hi> began to be raiſed to, by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling betwixt the two Brothers a War which would not end but by the entire ruine of him that ſhould be overcome,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53255:162"/> and ſuch a weakning of the Conqueror, that <hi>Spain</hi> would be ſo far from expecting new Conqueſts under him, that it would become a Prey to the firſt who ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it: That ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred and delivered themſelves from the Slavery of the <hi>Moors,</hi> they had been oftener ſubject to Civil Wars than Foreign, for no other reaſon but that the Nobles had been too powerful, and more apt to give Laws to their Maſters than to receive them from them: That they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves more modeſtly nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly under his Catholick Majeſty, but becauſe after his Marriage with Queen <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabella</hi> the Nobility of <hi>Caſtile</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſuccumbing under the Forces of <hi>Arragon</hi> which they doubted not but would pour in upon them, and that the Nobles of <hi>Arragon</hi> had had a juſter cauſe to fear their being run down by the Arms of thoſe of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> That if young <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> were King, one of the two would have time during his minority to take meaſures againſt him; and would retain ſo little reſpect for his Perſon becauſe he was but fourteen years of age and was not ſo well brought up as his elder brother, that they would oblige him at leaſt for ſome years to leave the publick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the Grandees of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53255:163"/> the chief of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly renew Civil Wars in <hi>Spain:</hi> That if his Catholick Majeſty ſuffering things to go according to their ordinary courſe called the Archduke to his Succeſſion, the Gentlemen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> would want both a pretext and means of revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: A pretext, in that the Archduke at ſixteen years of Age, was no leſs able to govern them than the wiſeſt Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have been: And means, ſeeing their Rebellion would inſtantly be cruſhed by the Forces which that Prince would raiſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and might eaſily bring into <hi>Spain</hi> by occaſion of the Treaty which he had ratified with the new King of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>The Catholick King ſtrangely ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and nevertheleſs convinced with this diſcourſe, made anſwer, that ſeeing he could not conveniently leave <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> to the Infanto, <note place="margin">In the laſt Council given to <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi>
               </note> He muſt at leaſt reſign to him the three great maſteries of the Order of St. <hi>James, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara,</hi> the Revenue whereof would be ſufficient for the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Prince of his quality: That his Majeſty at the ſame time he reſolved to make him his Heir, had written to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have him inveſted into
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53255:163"/> theſe three headſhips of Orders: That the Affair had been negotiated firſt with <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, and ſince with <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth; and that the chief difficulty that thoſe two Popes had found in it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Bull granted before by <hi>Julius,</hi> to the Commander <hi>Padilla</hi> which aſſured him of ſucceeding to his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in the great Maſtery of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he outlived him: That the Bull of <hi>Julius</hi> was inſignificant, ſince <hi>Padilla</hi> was dead, and that ſo nothing now hindred the expedition of that which allowed his Majeſty the reſignation of the three Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in favour of the Infanto. But the three Counſellors of State, being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the ſucceſs of their Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perſwaded that having obtained the chief point, his Majeſty would not long refuſe to grant them what was but acceſſory, replied to the Catholick King conjuring him to call to mind that when he and Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Wife had preſſed the Holy See to unite in their Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the three Maſteries in queſtion, the moſt important reaſon ſpecified in their addreſs was, that if none of the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſeparately were ſo powerful as their King, yet all three together were far more powerful. Whence it hapned that when they who were inveſted in thoſe dignities
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53255:164"/> confederated together to turn againſt their Maſters the Arms, Wealth, Vaſſals and Credit, which the Piety of Believers had left them for acting againſt the Infidels, they reduced them to the neceſſity of granting whatever they demanded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction and reſerve. That the Pope at that time touched with the force of that reaſon had written to his Nuntio in <hi>Spain</hi> to inform himſelf exactly if the matter were indeed ſo: That the Nuntio had ſent him anſwer that it was but too true, and that thereupon the three Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according as they became vacant, had been conferred upon his Catholick Majeſty. Whereupon they took the liberty once more to remonſtrate to the King that the brothers of Princes were ſometimes ſo ſtrongly tempted to Reign, that nothing hindred them from ſuccumbing under ſo nice a temptation but the inability to which the Laws thought it neceſſary to reduce them, by cutting them ſhort of the means of ſucceeding in it: That there were ſo many inſtances of it in all the Monarchies of <hi>Spain</hi> that 'twould be ſuperfluous to alledge them; and that without judging of the thoughts of the Infanto, it was ſufficient to obſerve that if one day he might have a mind of revolting againſt his Elder Brother, no Prince ever had or might have a fairer
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53255:164"/> pretext, or more infallible means of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, provided he were inveſted in theſe three Maſteries. That the pretext would be that the Infanto had right to demand a lawful ſhare in the Succeſſion of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actually dead, of his Uncle dead in Law, and of his Grandfathers when they ſhould be no more in being: That neither the Roman Laws, nor thoſe of the places where the Eſtates lay, nor the Cuſtoms which in ſuch caſes ſtand inſtead of Laws having preciſely enough regulated that legal Portion, it would depend upon the good or bad inclination of the Infanto to raiſe his claim ſo high that his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not conſent to it; and in that caſe the quarrel betwixt the two Brothers would degenerate into a Civil War ſo much the more to be excuſed on the part of the younger, as that he would only ſeem to demand his Portion. That he would not want means of getting men and money, ſeeing all the Commanders, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Knights of the three Orders whom he had preferred to Places, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides depended on him, would mount on Horſeback upon the firſt notice he ſhould give them; and bringing their Vaſſals with them would form ſo conſiderable an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that his elder Brother would have much ado to be able to meet him with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53255:165"/> the like: That it was impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine what the ſucceſs of that War might be; and all that could be affirmed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand was, that it would be an everlaſting Reproach to the memory of his Catholick Majeſty, that he had been at leaſt the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a War betwixt two Brothers by rendring the younger ſo powerful, that he might think himſelf in a condition of offending his elder Brother with ſafety.</p>
            <p>Though ambition be one of the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that takes poſſeſſion of the hearts of great Men, yet it is the laſt that leaves them; and as that had always been predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the Catholick King, ſo it made its laſt effort upon him to ſtiſle the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts that remained in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards the Infanto. Not but that he ſtill loved him as much as poſſibly he could, nor that he had any inclination for the Archduke; but the Idea of an univerſal Monarchy, flattering him at that moment above what can be imagined, without great reluctancy he ſacrificed the Infanto to the Archduke in the extremity of his ſickneſs, when he foreſaw that he could not long enough outlive what he was about to do to be in a condition to make reparation for it.</p>
            <p>We muſt however ſubjoyn in this place that before he abſolutely determined to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53255:165"/> diſinherit the Infanto, he made another inſtance to his three Miniſters in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. he told them that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely troubled to leave him in ſo poor a condition; but they replied poſitively that the greateſt and ſole riches of the younger of his Grandſons ought wholly to conſiſt in the favours of his elder Brother; <note place="margin">In the relation of that Conference.</note> becauſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to pretend to but by that way, he would be the more diligent in acquiring them, and more aſſiduous in preſerving the ſame. The Catholick King had hardly teſtified by his ſilence that he had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reply, when they went to his Cabinet to look for the original Will which he had made ſeven months before, and they burnt it before his face without any ſhew of regret on his part. He dictated and ſigned a new Will, ſo diſadvantageous to the Infanto that he made no mention of him, but only to leave him, as if he had been a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, an alimentary Penſion of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns upon ſome Lands in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Archduke was declared ſole and univerſal Heir of the Monarchies of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and of the Crowns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them without any mention of the reſtitution of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whatever
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53255:166"/> Hiſtorians, who are not <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſay to the contrary. The three great Maſteries were reſigned to the Archduke; and the Infanto, who had been as near a Throne as one could be without mounting it, was put off with a Penſion of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, that bore no proportion to the vaſt Eſtates whereof he was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>The Catholick King was not quitted for having ſtifled in his breſt the three moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of his inclinations, which were his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the younger of his Grandchildren, his indifference for the Elder, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>Chievres,</hi> who, next to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, profited moſt of any by the ſecond Teſtament, ſeeing he was ſure under him to govern <hi>Spain</hi> ſo long as he lived. Able Miniſters never ſtop unſeaſonably in the middle of their enterpriſes; and <hi>Zapata, Carvaial,</hi> and <hi>Vargas,</hi> finding their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in a diſpoſition to grant them all that would have been denied them in another Juncture; preſſed him in the laſt place to uſe a violence upon himſelf, which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability muſt have coſt him more than all the other three put together. It hath been obſerved in the foregoing Book that the Catholick King could not have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor more deeply rooted averſion to Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> than he had: That he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53255:166"/> had uſed all means to get him depoſed: That he had raiſed perſecutions againſt him of a very long continuance; and that the Cardinal had not ſo much maintained himſelf by his parts and reputation as by the advice which <hi>Chievres</hi> had given the Archduke to ſupport in the perſon of <hi>Ximenes</hi> an intelligent and ſteddy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who would always oppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Catholick King upon <hi>Caſtile</hi> if he found them not to be conform to the Laws of the Country. To ſpeak the truth, His Majeſty had ſuccumbed in the quarrel, ſeeing he had been forced to let the Cardinal live in peace; and his enmity thereupon was encreaſed towards him, whether he apprehended the reſentment of that Prelate, or that he could not think of it with patience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it never came into his mind, but that it ſeemed to upbraid him with the want of power to undo him. Nevertheleſs theſe three Counſellours took a reſolution to oblige <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to pardon the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the moſt glorious manner that could be imagined for that Prelate, that is to ſay, in leaving him the full adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi> till the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke ſhould arrive, and he put in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. They thereupon repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Majeſty that one thing ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53255:167"/> to be done by him for the entire tranquillity of <hi>Spain</hi> after his death, and for obliging the People whom he had ſo long governed in peace to bleſs his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever: That the Archduke was not in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that in all appearance could not ſuddenly be, what diligence ſoever he might uſe, ſeeing it behoved him to give Orders for the Affairs of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries during his abſence, <hi>Chievres</hi> being too much a Courtier to remain behind, and not to follow his Maſter: That in the mean time the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> having no more authority would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be ſufficient for the Government of the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> there being no inſtance that ever it had attempted to give Orders during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval betwixt two Reigns, and before the lawful Succeſſour had been owned for King in the Eſtates of the two Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies: That therefore it was neceſſary to name one or more Regents: That if more than one were named, it would ſtrike at the moſt important deſign of his Catholick Majeſty, which conſiſted in uniting all the Monarchies of <hi>Spain</hi> in ſo ſtrict a manner, that they could not for the future be divided again: That by diſuſing the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> from living under one and the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53255:167"/> they would call to mind that heretofore they had been two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Monarchies, and have reaſon to think that ſtill they might be; and ſeeing both the one and other deſired nothing more paſſionately than to return to their former ſtate as to that particular, they would by that means be touched in the moſt ſenſible part, and ſeeds of revolting be ſown amongſt them which would not fail to break out in time: That nevertheleſs there was nothing more difficult than to find out a ſingle perſon capable of the whole Government of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that if he were choſen from amongſt thoſe of inferiour quality, the Nobility were too haughty to obey him: if he were taken out of the body of the Nobles, <note place="margin">In the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of the three Miniſters to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </note> he muſt either be a Grandee, or meaner Gentleman: If he were a Grandee, ſeeing there was no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in that Order but only the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Grandeeſhip, the other Grandees if they were more ancient in dignity than he that ſhould be Regent, would refuſe to ſubmit to him; and if they were not, they would pretend that the Regency which was but a tranſient Commiſſion, would not ſufficiently authoriſe him to command them: That thereby a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53255:168"/> and laſting pretext would without minding it be furniſhed to the reſtleſs <hi>Spaniards</hi> of revolting, and to the wiſer of forbearing to declare themſelves till they ſaw to which ſide victory ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline: That to remedy that there was a neceſſity of pitching upon a man, who on the one hand was not noble, and on the other was raiſed above the Grandees by the eminent dignities which he might be inveſted with, and for which he was only indebted to his own merit, his incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonal qualities, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervices which he had rendered to the State: That there was none other but Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> Primate of all <hi>Spain,</hi> in quality of Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and that to make a true eſtimate of that great Man, either there would be no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in truſting him with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in queſtion, or if there were any it would be incomparably leſs in him than in any other who might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him, whether within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Catholick King was never more ſurpriſed than when he heard <hi>Ximenes</hi> named to govern <hi>Spain</hi> after his death. He thought leſs on the injuries he had done than on thoſe which he had received; and ſeeing he concluded that though the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53255:168"/> Cardinal and he were reconciled, yet he was ſtill offended with him becauſe he would have taken his Archbiſhoprick from him, he did not look upon him as his friend. Upon that conſideration his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty replied to the three Miniſters in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſorder; That they muſt needs have forgot what had paſt betwixt the Cardinal and him during ſome years, that they propoſed to him of all <hi>Spaniards</hi> the perſon whom he had greateſt reaſon to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt: That he might tell them again upon his deaths bed what he had ſo many times repreſented unto them, that <hi>Ximenes</hi> was an ungrateful man, who being obliged to him for all his fortune had refuſed him to make an exchange of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo</hi> for the Atchbiſhoprick of <hi>Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa;</hi> but the Judgment-Seat of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which he was going to appear to give an account of his actions, put into his mind thoughts more abſtracted from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love: That he was willing at preſent to acknowledge that in the quarrel he had had with the Cardinal it was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear which of the two was in the right; nay, and if it were ſtill alledged that his Majeſty had been in the wrong, he was ready to acknowledge it: but that it was for the very ſame reaſon he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that of all the <hi>Spaniards Ximenes</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:53255:169"/> was the laſt whom he ought to deſign for the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> during the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Archduke, ſeeing he was a perſon offended: that he had been put to it at an unſeaſonable time; that all means had been uſed to depoſe him, inſtead of giving him rewards ſuitable to his great Services, and that he had been reduced to ſue for Foreign protection: That he would not fail to ſuſpect when contrary to his expectation he ſhould learn that he were named Regent, that it was only for fault of another ſubject as capable as himſelf of ſo different a Commiſſion; and that therefore he would not only think himſelf not at all obliged to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty for it, but would alſo think of revenging himſelf upon him in the perſons of his Grandſons: That he might very well give way to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of raiſing the younger to the Throne, were it for no other reaſon than in that particular to croſs the laſt Will of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty; and that though he might not be ſo bold as to attempt it, nor ſo wicked as to put the ſame in execution, yet the leaſt inconvenience to be expected from him, would be that when he found himſelf in power, he would labour ſo to ſettle himſelf in the Government, that it would be impoſſible for the Archduke to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53255:169"/> take it from him when he had a mind to it; and ſeeing that Cardinal was a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ability, either the thing was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unpracticable, or elſe he would ſucceed in it.</p>
            <p>The Counſellours of State made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the probity of the Cardinal ſo well known to all men that even his own enemies agreed in it, made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſo horrible a piece of injuſtice; and that though he were, yet his former conduct had put him out of a condition of governing <hi>Spain</hi> any other way than under the pleaſure and authority of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That he propoſed to himſelf at firſt to croſs the Grandees of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and had attracted their averſion in ſo implacable a manner, that it would be impoſſible for him for the future to be reconciled unto them though he laboured it with all the policy and perſeverance that are natural to him: That not having the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on his ſide, <note place="margin">In his life by the Univerſity of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala.</hi>
               </note> and that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the moſt conſiderable of the State failing him when he ſtood moſt in need of them; if notwithſtanding he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to continue his adminiſtration as long as he lived, his efforts would only ſerve to make him ſuccumb the ſooner.</p>
            <p>The Catholick King agreed with them in the opinion of the Cardinals integrity; and the Miniſters finding him give that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53255:170"/> teſtimony to the truth, added that this Prelate had two other qualities beſides which rendered him no leſs conſiderable; the one, that he had always had a great zeal for the enlargement of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the other that he had no Relations, and that his Family ending with himſelf, as it had begun by him, nothing would take him off from procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by all means the intereſts of the Archduke. The Catholick King preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Conſcience to be ſincere at leaſt in the laſt moments of his life, agreed alſo in the ſecond and third commendations which his Miniſters gave the Cardinal; and he had no ſooner done ſo, but that they drew the concluſion from thence; That ſeeing there was no other <hi>Spaniard</hi> bred up in the Maxims of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment who had the ſame qualities, as he had, his Catholick Majeſty ought for the good of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy which he had formed, to ſacrifice the ſmall reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he entertained againſt <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and nominate him Regent of <hi>Spain</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abſence of the Archduke.</p>
            <p>The nearer People approach to death, the leſs able are they to reſiſt importunities, and the Catholick King at length yielded to the Sollicitations of his Miniſters. He put the laſt conſtraint upon himſelf; and pardoning him whom of all men next to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53255:170"/> 
               <hi>Chievres</hi> he hated moſt, he truſted him with that which was deareſt to him in this world, that is to ſay, the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Three or four hours after he died; and it is not doubted but that if he had done what we have related by the motives of the Goſpel his end had been happy. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doval,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> muſt needs have imagined ſo, ſince he poſitively affirms that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> went ſtreight from little <hi>Madrigal</hi> to Paradice.</p>
            <p>They who had the care of the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Infanto ſo little apprehended that the late King had ſuppreſſed and altered the Teſtament which he had made the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>June</hi> One thouſand five hundred and fifteen in favours of that young Prince, and whereof he had ſent them a Copy, that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Maſters of the Government, when they were informed that his Catholick Majeſty died an hour and a half after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night the three and twentieth of <hi>January</hi> One thouſand five hundred and ſixteen. They ſpent no time in conſidering with Chriſtian contemplation, that a Monarch who had conquered three whole Kingdoms was dead in one of the wretchedeſt houſes of all <hi>Spain.</hi> They left that reflection to thoſe who had a mind to check their own ambition, and thought of nothing but of putting themſelves as ſoon as they could
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53255:171"/> into the poſſeſſion of the Authority which they pretended to be devolved upon them. They framed a Letter for the Infanto to the Counſellours of State of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein he ſpake to them as their Maſter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to come to him to <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luppa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hiſtory and the Manuſcripts have not retained the name of him to whom it was directed to be communicated to the reſt, and no body can tell whether it was not to one of thoſe three who had done the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto the bad office we have been ſpeaking of; but it is certain, that he ſuffered not the Courtiers of young <hi>Ferdinand</hi> long to flatter themſelves in their imaginary good fortune. However having conferred with his Colleagues he judged it not fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in Writing, becauſe that would have ſeemed in ſome ſenſe to have approved the Contents of the Letter; and beſides, it would have been very hard to have found terms that would not have given the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto ground of offence if the anſwer had been Categorical. The Miniſter therefore made anſwer only by word of mouth, that the Council ſhould not fail to come with all expedition to <hi>Guadaluppa,</hi> and diſcharge themſelves to the Infanto of the duty they owed to the only Brother of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: but that ſeeing the Infanto was too much a Gentleman to pretend to any
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53255:171"/> thing more, the Miniſters took the liberty to tell him that they owned no other King but <hi>Caeſar.</hi> So plain a Declaration that paſs'd ſince for a Propheſie when the Archduke was choſen Emperour, ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed the chief Servants of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto, that they remained immovable whilſt the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> took neceſſary meaſures for eſtabliſhing the Archduke in the Monarchy which they had ſaved for him. The <hi>Infanto</hi> himſelf, though too young to lay to heart diſcontents of the nature of that which he had received, was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo touched with it, that he fell into a quartan Ague, which held him a long time.</p>
            <p>The firſt care of the Council was in all haſte to ſend for Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> and Doctor <hi>Adrian,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the Hiſtory of his Education.</note> who in <hi>Spain</hi> went by the name of the Dean of <hi>Louvain.</hi> So ſoon as they were come the Late Kings Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was opened in their preſence; and the Dean was no leſs aſtoniſhed to find no mention of himſelf in it, than the Cardinal was to ſee himſelf named Regent. The Dean ſuppoſed that ſince his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at his death had rendered Juſtice to the Archduke, he ſhould have crowned the work by leaving the adminiſtration of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy to the ſole Miniſter of the Archdukes in <hi>Spain,</hi> which was himſelf; and the Cardinal could not ſufficiently
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53255:172"/> admire that good fortune had advanced him to a dignity, from which no man in <hi>Spain</hi> ſeemed more remote than himſelf. But at the very inſtant he intended to take poſſeſſion of it, the Dean oppoſed it in a manner that would have long perplexed the Miniſters, if he had not remitted after that it had been repreſented to him that an Affair of that importance ſo happily carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on till then, would go near to be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the leaſt reſiſtance on his part. However he ſhew'd them a Commiſſion in ample form from the Archduke for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his name the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> in caſe the King his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould die; and demanded at leaſt that he might be allowed to execute one half of his Commiſſion with the Cardinal, ſeeing the occaſion was come, and that they would not ſuffer him to execute it alone: But the Cardinal, who was not a man to yield, replied, that it ſhould coſt him his life, but that the Will of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould be fulfilled in its full extent. The Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> who knew him well, had no hopes of bending him, and did not indeed think it convenient to endeavour it. They thought it better to apply themſelves to the Dean; and to tell him that in <hi>Spain</hi> they were ſo well ſatisfied with his great integrity, that they could make him Judge in his own cauſe, they were ſo well aſſured
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53255:172"/> that he would condemn himſelf when he ſhould be convinced of the badneſs of it. That they thought it not ſtrange that he who was a <hi>Fleming,</hi> and by conſequent born in a Country far diſtant from <hi>Spain,</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> foreſeeing the diſtemper of mind to which her eldeſt Daughter had ſome diſpoſition, had ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Archduke her eldeſt Son to her, upon two conditions; firſt, that he ſhould not reign in <hi>Caſtile</hi> before he were twenty years of age compleat: and ſecondly, that he could not during his Minority truſt the adminiſtration of that Monarchy in the hands of any ſtranger: whence it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be concluded, that ſeeing the Dean was debarred from the Government of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> by ſo plain an Excluſion, he could not as a man of honour pretend to it.</p>
            <p>They further added, that he was no leſs formally excluded from the adminiſtration of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſeeing the late Catholick King to whom it belonged as <hi>Caſtile</hi> had belonged to the Queen his Wife, had left the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to Cardinal <hi>Ximenes.</hi> That if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he undertook to make uſe of his Commiſſion which he brought with him from <hi>Flanders,</hi> he would raiſe a Civil War in <hi>Spain,</hi> and muſt anſwer to God for all the murders and other crimes that might be committed in it, as he himſelf had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged beforehand in his excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53255:173"/> upon the <hi>Maſter of Sentences,</hi> where he taught that a man raiſing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in a State when he could hinder them without injury to his Conſcience or his Honour, was anſwerable for all the evils that might thereupon enſue.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice before that the Dean was an honeſt man, and that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not fully the Trade he medled in. He was ſo charmed with the deference that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> teſtified for him in referring to himſelf an Affair wherein he was a Party, and with the honour they did him in citing the Writings which he had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore dictated in the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain,</hi> and cauſed afterwards to be Printed, that he promiſed to ſubmit to what the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould determine, provided an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient might be found to ſecure his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and might not expoſe the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Archduke to be thought ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. The Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> who did not expect that the Dean would condeſcend ſo far, took him at his word, and propoſed to him to be ſatisfied with ſome ſhare that the Cardinal ſhould give him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The offer was plauſible in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but in effect was doubly captious: For in the firſt place to ſhare the Regency with a native <hi>Spaniard</hi> was to make him his Maſter, ſeeing his Sentiments in the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> would always prevail
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53255:173"/> over thoſe of a <hi>Fleming;</hi> and in the ſecond place, the reputation of the Cardinal ſo far ſurpaſſed that of the Dean, that whatever might be his merit, yet it was only to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that if there were two Regents, it would happen in <hi>Spain</hi> as it commonly happens in the Heavens, that the light of a higher Planet wholly obſcures that of the lower Star, and that the Dean would have no greater ſhare in the Government than if he were not at all aſſociated in it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he condeſcended to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient on the terms propoſed to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſiring time to write about it to the Archduke and <hi>Chievres,</hi> and without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the reſolution which the Council of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> might take upon an Affair of that importance. And, indeed, he was the firſt that repented of his precipitancy, becauſe he had no ſooner conſented that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſhould act joyntly with him in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs, than that Prelate left him no more but the name of Regent. He diſpatched without him all Affairs that concerned not the Sovereign Authority, and for the others he did indeed propoſe them in the Council where the Dean was preſent, and they were exactly enough examined there. If the reſolution that was taken in Council were equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the mind of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and Dean, <note place="margin">In the Deans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke.</note> it was the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53255:174"/> better for the Dean whoſe opinion was then followed. But if the Cardinal and Dean were of contrary opinions, as it hapned but too often, the Dean muſt comply with the Cardinals opinion, and if he did not, yet the buſineſs ſtill went as the Cardinal decided in it. The Dean was then obliged to ſign in the ſecond place the Acts that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt his advice; and if he perſiſted to refuſe to ſet his name to the reſolutions which he had diſapproved, they were for all that put in execution. It was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for him to take exceptions at it: his complaints were patiently heard; and that was all the ſatisfaction he had, ſeeing after all there was no more regard had to them than if he had held his peace.</p>
            <p>They ſhewed him a little more reſpect in the diſpatches that were to be ſent to the Low Countries, and none were ſent thither unleſs he had ſigned them: but that Society was prejudicial inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantageous to him, ſince moſt of the Affairs that were treated there were not moulded as the Archdukes Council would have had them. That Council inſtead of imputing all the fault to the Cardinal, who alone was concerned in it, attributed it to the Dean as thinking him ſufficiently au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to have prevented if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Archduke from being importuned with ſuch like diſpatches.</p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:53255:174"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> nevertheleſs ſpied in the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Conduct that it aimed at fixing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf during life in an adminiſtration which was only given him during the time of a ſhort minority; and at rendering the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke contemptible upon his coming to the enjoyment of the two chief Monarchies of <hi>Spain,</hi> when he ſtood moſt in need of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the eſteem of his new Subjects. It was evident that a condeſcenſion in that caſe would have been equally mean and dangerous; and the expedient which <hi>Chievres</hi> deviſed to remedy it as quietly as he could, was to counſel the Archduke to multiply the number of Regents in <hi>Spain.</hi> The reaſon he gave for it was, that ſo long as that dignity was only exerciſed by the Cardinal and Dean, the firſt of the two would always carry it over the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had the better of him in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. That nevertheleſs he muſt have a care not to recal the Dean, ſeeing the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being generally too quaint and ſharp-ſighted in their conjectures, would preſently gueſs that the Council of <hi>Flanders</hi> were ſenſible of, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the fault that they had committed in ſending into <hi>Spain</hi> a man abſolutely inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcharging the Commiſſion that was put upon him: but that if a new Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league more cunning in intrigues and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in buſineſs than himſelf were joyned
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53255:175"/> with him, the Cardinal durſt not dare to refuſe the admitting of him into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and the <hi>Flemings</hi> having there two voices to one, would become the abſolute Maſters of all the reſolutions that might be taken there.</p>
            <p>The chief difficulty that appeared, was the choice of the Miniſter that ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the place of a third Regent: and by this means it was maſtered. The Archduke had no ſooner been informed of the death of his Maternal Grandfather but that by the advice of <hi>Chievres</hi> he went and took <hi>John Manuel,</hi> of whom we have already ſpoken, out of the Priſon where he had lain ſo long through the obſtinate reſolution of the Catholick King that he ſhould be kept there: The pretext that was made uſe of for giving that <hi>Spaniard</hi> his liberty, was the kindneſs that the Archdukes Father had had for him, and the important ſervices that he had rendered to him: but the true cauſe was, that <hi>Chievres</hi> intended to oppoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> to the Cardinal, and by means of this man to hinder him from taking to himſelf greater Authority in <hi>Spain</hi> than it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the intereſts of the Archduke that he ſhould have. <hi>Chievres</hi> his conjecture was not ill-grounded, ſeeing the Cardinal had croſſed, as much as lay in his power, the promotion of <hi>Manuel.</hi> He had attempted to have obliged <hi>Philip</hi> the Firſt to turn
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53255:175"/> him away: he had ſince openly perſecuted him; and if he did not put the late Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King upon obliging his Grandſon to commit, and detain him long in Priſon, yet at leaſt it was believed that he had been aſſiſtant in confirming his Majeſty in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he had taken about it: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Chievres</hi> changed his opinion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and thought he had reaſon to do ſo. It would be hard to tell preciſely whether he did well or ill in that particular: but if he did well, Poſterity ought not to find fault with his Conduct; and if he did ill, his fault was leſſened by the cauſe that <hi>Manuel</hi> gave him not to look upon him any more as his friend.</p>
            <p>No men in the world are ſo impatient of impriſonment as thoſe who are cut out for Intrigues, becauſe they then reckon for loſt all the Minutes of their life which have not been employed in actions that are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a Priſon. <hi>Manuel</hi> had been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ten whole years, and that was more than enough to put him out of humour, and the rather that during ſo long a ſpace he had loſt all the acquaintance and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence that he had made and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> He knew not whom to blame for it; and it was more for want of another object than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the pretended infidelity of <hi>Chievres</hi> that he ſuſpected he had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53255:176"/> him. He thought that if there was no malice on the part of that Governour, yet at leaſt there was negligence; and that in either caſe he was to be blamed, though nothing near ſo much for the latter as for the former. The friendſhip of Politicians is more inconſtant than that of other men, becauſe it is hardly ever proof againſt the leaſt ſuſpicion. <hi>Manuel</hi> quickly added a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thought to his former, much more diſadvantageous to <hi>Chievres,</hi> in ſuppoſing that he had ſuffered him to languiſh in a Priſon, for fear leſt if he had taken him out, or that if he had procured his deliverance, he might have ſupplanted him by becoming the chief Miniſter and Favourite of the Archdukes as he had been of his Father. So that when <hi>Chievres</hi> went to wait upon the Archduke when he ſet <hi>Manuel</hi> at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Manuel</hi> embraced him not ſo kindly as he uſed to do, and that was the firſt mark of his indifference. The ſecond appeared in that he would have no particular corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with <hi>Chievres;</hi> and the third in that, that at the time when he was enlarged, finding the Archdukes Court divided into two Factions, one which ſtuck to <hi>Chievres</hi> and the other that had forſaken him, and owned the Biſhop of <hi>Badajos</hi> for chief, <hi>Manuel,</hi> having regained his liberty, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took his Party, and declared for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop againſt his Benefactor.</p>
            <pb n="303" facs="tcp:53255:176"/>
            <p>That was enough to give <hi>Chievres</hi> cauſe to foreſee that if <hi>Manuel</hi> were ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> he would make his reconciliation with <hi>Ximenes:</hi> He would ſecond his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the Council, and render thoſe of the Dean ineffectual. That was the real cauſe of the Archdukes refuſing to give him the Commiſſion, though he ſollicited it with extraordinary importunity; and the Archduke to comfort him told him, that he thought him ſo neceſſary about his perſon, to conſult with concerning the diſpatches that came to him from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Anſwers that he was to make to them, that he could not reſolve to part with him out of ſight.</p>
            <p>So that for a third Regent was choſen the Lord <hi>de la Chau,</hi> of younger ſtanding than the Dean in the Council of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but more knowing in Politicks, and more accuſtomed to diſſemble than he. <hi>La Chau</hi> was without difficulty received by the Cardinal and Dean for a Colleague; but he was not the more advanced for that, and Affairs went no better for the <hi>Flemings</hi> in the Council of <hi>Spain. Ximenes</hi> was no leſs powerful there than he had been before; and as his ſole voice carried it from the Dean when he had no other Colleague but him; ſo it carried it ſtill notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had two <hi>Flemings</hi> againſt him in moſt Affairs that came under debate.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53255:177"/> The Dean was ſo well accuſtomed to that uſage, that he was ſcarcely any more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at it, and perhaps it was by that compliance that he obliged <hi>Ximenes</hi> to give him the Biſhoprick of <hi>Torloſa</hi> in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia:</hi> But <hi>La Chau</hi> could not endure not to enjoy the full exerciſe of his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after that his Letters Patents for it were verified. He complained of it next day after; and upon the refuſal of the Juſtice which he demanded, he wrote to <hi>Chievres</hi> a full account of the affront which the Archduke received in his Perſon, and in the Perſon of the Biſhop of <hi>Torloſa</hi> his Colleague.</p>
            <p>The Archduke and <hi>Chievres</hi> were put to an extraordinary plunge what to do. If they offended <hi>Ximenes,</hi> they would afford him the pretext which, perhaps, he look'd for of revolting, by reducing him to a neceſſity of raiſing the Infanto to the Throne, to the end he might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf in his Regency; and if they offended him not, they would give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo to ſlight the Archduke, that that people perſuaded naturally that Sovereigns ought not to ſuffer any thing but what they cannot avoid, would of themſelves deſire the Infanto for their King. There was much caſting about for a mean that was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant from thoſe two dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53255:177"/> and <hi>Chievres</hi> having weighed the matter well, at length found out two.</p>
            <p>The firſt was to refuſe <hi>Ximenes</hi> what he moſt ſollicitouſly demanded of the Archduke. This cannot be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without obſerving that the late Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King in complying with the advice of the three Miniſters who counſelled him to give the Regency to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> had done it after the manner of Kings, who are not much troubled that Poſterity ſhould know, that their laſt Wills have not been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free. He had limited the Regency of the Cardinal with ſo many reſtrictions, that hardly had he authority enough to make the Archduke be obeyed in <hi>Spain</hi> when he ſhould ſend ſuch Orders as required an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſeverity. The three Miniſters perceived that very well, <note place="margin">In the laſt Will of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </note> but they judged it not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to inſiſt upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the power of the Regent, either becauſe they had no hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, or that they thought <hi>Ximenes</hi> a man able enough in the proceſs of time and affairs to give a ſufficient extent to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which was left him with too great limitation. The Catholick King died in the interim; and <hi>Ximenes</hi> having taken poſſeſſion of the Regency had diſpatched many Couriers to the Archduke, to deſire
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53255:178"/> that the reſtrictions whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, might be left out in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which was to be ſent him from <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had repreſented that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who outwardly boaſted of an entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not only to their Monarchs, but alſo to thoſe who had the honour to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, were inwardly more reſerved in matter of ſubmiſſion than any other People in <hi>Europe:</hi> That they would not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obey but in things that they could not avoid, and that in all things elſe the great Men of the Country would pretend the Royal Authority was devolved upon them, and that ſo there would be an Anarchy in <hi>Spain,</hi> from which the leaſt miſchief that could enſue would be a Civil War.</p>
            <p>The Archduke and <hi>Chievres</hi> did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree but that the reaſons of <hi>Ximenes</hi> were ſtrong and true; but they were ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an opinion that that Cardinal would abuſe the Royal Authority if it were wholly put into his hands, that the Letters of <hi>La Chau</hi> made them abſolutely reſolve to ſend no more to <hi>Ximenes</hi> but a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the power which he had from the Catholick King without addition, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, or alteration of any thing in it, and the Cardinal was as much nettled thereat as they who mortified him intended he ſhould: but as on the one hand to ſhew
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53255:178"/> any reſentment would have encreaſed their Joy, and that on the other, he would have diſcovered thereby his weakneſs to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who would not have failed to make their advantage of it, ſo he hit upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient which alone might rank him above all the Politicians that went before him. He pretended to have received from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke an unlimited power, and governed in as abſolute a manner as if he had really ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. In the mean time he doubled his inſtances at the Court of <hi>Flanders</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it in a more ample form; and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to the Archduke, that if it were obſtinately denied him, he would neither anſwer for <hi>Caſtile</hi> nor <hi>Arragon.</hi> But the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> were too impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the credit they were fallen from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> to be long led by the noſe by the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>Their Friends at the Court of <hi>Flanders</hi> gave them advice that the Prelate was not in ſo great favour there as they imagined; &amp; that ſo far from enlarging the power which the Catholick King had left him, as with much ado it was confirmed, nay, &amp; in danger of being recalled. This was pleaſant News; and the Grandees no ſooner received it, but they met to conſult what uſe they ſhould make thereof. They unanimouſly reſolved, that three of the greateſt quality, who were the Duke of <hi>Infantado,</hi> the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:53255:179"/> and the Count of <hi>Benevent,</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and ask him by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he who was but a Prieſt, and held the Regency only of a bare Adminiſtrator of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> yet diſpoſed of all things as Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as if he were the Archduke himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who had Spies amongſt them, was acquainted with the deputation almoſt as ſoon as it was reſolved upon, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to elude it in the manner following. He would not exerciſe the Regency in the City of <hi>Burgos,</hi> becauſe he foreſaw that his Perſon would not be ſecure there, and had choſen <hi>Madrid</hi> for that purpoſe, a Town which properly belonged to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo.</hi> He had put himſelf in a condition there of withſtanding any Riot, and as to an open War he had taken other meaſures, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel of this Hiſtory. The three above mentioned Grandees went to him there, and diſcharged their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion after their way, that is, in a very haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty manner. <hi>Ximenes</hi> commanded his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much as not to reply to them in the ſame ſtrain, &amp; only told them civilly that he held his power of the late King of glorious memory, to whom the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſufficiently endebted to oblige them to fulfil his laſt Will, though he was but Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Grandees were not ſatisfied with the anſwer of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> yet they durſt not neither contradict it openly.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53255:179"/> They replied, that the Teſtament he ſpake of did not give him authority to govern in a more abſolute manner than the Catholick King had done, whoſe Commiſſioner never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he only pretended to be, in deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the cuſtom introduced by that wiſe Prince and Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Wife into the Council of State, by propoſing matters there only ſuperficially, and as of courſe, and then in deciding them by himſelf alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the plurality of voices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> made anſwer without any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heat, <note place="margin">In the Collection of the Sentiments of the Cardinal.</note> that ſeeing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the late King their common Maſter ſeemed not ſufficient, he would ſhew them another. Having ſpoken theſe words, he led them to a Window of the Hall of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, from whence might be ſeen what was in the back Court of his Palace, and there let them ſee ten or twelve Pieces of Cannon mounted on Carriages, and all ſorts of fire-Arms ready to diſcharge. He had no ſooner given the ſignal but they who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it fired, and during the ſpace of more than a quarter of an hour nothing was to be heard but a terrible noiſe. <hi>Ximenes</hi> and the Grandees changed countenance then, and the Cardinal looked as if he had been all on fire. He uttered not one word, but the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his eyes ſufficiently ſupplied the uſe of his tongue; and made them ſenſible
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53255:180"/> that they had provoked him as much as poſſibly he could be.</p>
            <p>The Grandees on the contrary were as low as they had been high before. They ſpake no more than the Cardinal did, but their ſilence proceeded from another cauſe. They had declared themſelves his enemies, forced him out of patience, come to his Houſe to threaten him; and they judged their death the nearer that they had heard the moſt aſtoniſhing forerunners of it. But when the noiſe was over, <hi>Ximenes</hi> reaſſured them by telling them in a Magiſterial tone that the Artillery which they ſaw was the ampleſt power that he had to ſhew them. That they who would ſuffer him to act with that extent of power which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of <hi>Spain</hi> in general, and for the intereſts of the Archduke in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſhould have no cauſe to be affraid: but that he was willing to let them know and give them notice beforehand, that the Artillery whereof they had now heard the roaring, was deſigned to thunder againſt thoſe who having no ſufficient title to ask him a reaſon of his Conduct, were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſo pragmatical as to do it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon diſmiſſed the three Grandees, and ſuch a bold action of a man bred up amongſt <hi>Cordeliers</hi> as cannot be paralelled by any other in the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> was of no hurtful conſequence to its Author.</p>
            <pb n="311" facs="tcp:53255:180"/>
            <p>The other mortification that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke and <hi>Chievres</hi> thought fit to give to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> was to render his Regency ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous by dividing it amongſt too many. We have already mentioned that the Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>La Chau</hi> were put upon him for Colleagues; and theſe two Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither able to counterpoiſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor to leſſen it by ſharing therein, they gave him a fourth Colleague more daring than they, and leſs reſerved when it came to the puſh of putting himſelf into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the full power that might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him. His name was <hi>Amerſtorf,</hi> deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one of the moſt ancient and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous families of <hi>Holland.</hi> He was a man of wit, and the humour of his Country incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him never to give over what once he had undertaken. His arrival at <hi>Madrid</hi> was acceptable to <hi>Ximenes</hi> inſtead of being troubleſom to him, becauſe he furniſhed him with the pretext which he had been long looking out for of ridding himſelf of the Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>La Chau.</hi> The truth is theſe two Miniſters though they were more ſubmiſſive than he durſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf, were nevertheleſs very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to him, ſeeing it was ſtill to be feared that they would ſhake off the yoke. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then <hi>Amerſtorf</hi> with as much civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as he had received the other two, and brought him into the Council of <hi>Spain;</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:53255:181"/> but afterward he took his time privately to repreſent to all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters of State who had the honour to ſit there; That the Archduke, who was not as yet their King, began to ſtrike at the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable root of their Priviledges, which conſiſted in not being governed by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: That already two <hi>Flemings</hi> and a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> were ſlipt into the Council; and if that encroachment were not inſtantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, others would be ſent over in ſo great number that they would exceed the native <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That the inconvenience could not be avoided but by hindering the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Flanders</hi> for the future from intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing into that of <hi>Spain</hi> as many perſons as they pleaſed, which could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed but by two means: Firſt, not to communicate Affairs of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the three foreign Regents; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not to ſuffer them to ſign diſpatches.

For the ſecond, there needed no more but to make the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the multitude of perſons who muſt ſign all that was granted them in favour or in juſtice; and to put them in the head of grounding their grievances upon the op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53255:181"/> that their Predeceſſours made to the deſigns of the Catholick King, when after he had married Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> he would have ſigned with her the Grants and Expeditions that concerned the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Spain</hi> acknowledged the expedients propoſed by <hi>Ximenes</hi> to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and conſented that there ſhould be Cabinet Councils in the Cardinals Palace. Soon after the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> were heard to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur about the tediouſneſs of expeditions which they imputed to the number of thoſe who were to ſign them, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ximenes</hi> was prayed to ſign them alone. None but the Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and <hi>Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorf</hi> oppoſed it; but the Council baffled their reſiſtance by asking them the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if they were willing alone to bear the blame of an inſurrection which was like to happen all over <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe the people of that vaſt Country were refuſed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which they deſired.</p>
            <p>The Archduke and <hi>Chievres</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the attempt of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and of the affront they received in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves a long time of means how they might puniſh the firſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the ſecond. But having reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter as ſeriouſly as ſo nice an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair deſerved, they thought beſt at that time to wink at it; ſeeing all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that could be imployed without
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53255:182"/> having power in hand to force them, would only ſerve to confirm the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their bad intentions if they had any, and make them more remiſs in the good which they might have. Immediately after an occaſion offered wherein the Court of <hi>Flanders</hi> had ſo much need of the Cardinals wiſdom, and of the authority which he had acquired, and retained in ſpight of them, that though they had made a publick rupture with him, they muſt have been forced to have court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his friendſhip. It ran in <hi>Chievres</hi> his head that ſo long as the Archduke was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Title of Heir apparent of the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> he would not be ſure of ſucceeding to them; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in right to prefer his younger brother before him, founded upon this, that the caſe had not as yet hapned ſince they had ſhaken off the yoak of the <hi>Moors,</hi> that a ſtranger had reigned over them. That it was convenient then to ply them on the ſide of conſcience, and to oblige them to the Archduke by a particular Oath, engaging them to acknowledge him for their King, before he was actually ſo by the death of his Mother the Queen. That could not be done but by the reſignation of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for though ſhe had loſt her judgment in ſo deplorable a manner that her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry employment was to fight with Cats,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53255:182"/> in which ridiculous Combat ſhe received ſcratches that disfigured her face, yet ſhe retained ſo lively and preſent an Idea of the Grandeur to which ſhe was advanced by the death of her elder Brother and Siſter without Children, that ſhe continually thought on it, and never confounded it with any other fancy: as if it had been the deſign of God Almighty to ſhew in her by the moſt evident and remarkable inſtance that ever was, that the deepeſt wound that ever was, that the deepeſt wound of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin conſiſts in the deſire of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and that that remains when all the reſt are cured, or ceaſe through the incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jane</hi> the fooliſh in the height of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagnncies remembred very well that ſhe was in her own right Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon;</hi> and though the extraordinary love ſhe had for her Husband kept her from taking it ill that he gave her no ſhare in the Government of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> yet after his death ſhe was not ſo compleſant to her own Father; and told thoſe who wondered at it, That <hi>near was her ſmock, but nearer her skin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing it is the moſt uſual mark of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thoſe who are altogether ſo, to think themſelves very wiſe; <hi>Jane</hi> could not endure that the Catholick King had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined her to the Caſtle of <hi>Tordeſilas,</hi> and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53255:183"/> kept her there ſhut up contrary to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. She called him her Tyrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of her Father: She called all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians</hi> that came to wait upon her Rebels; ſhe never beheld them without upbraiding them with diſloyalty, and conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they ſhould riſe in Arms to deliver her out of captivity, and to place her on the Throne. Her paſſion to Reign inſtead of diminiſhing as ſhe grew in age, encreaſed by the death of the Catholick King, which was not thought neceſſary to be kept from her. Then ſhe pretended to the Sovereignty of <hi>Arragon</hi> as well as to that of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and when ſhe was put to it, as many times ſhe was, what ſhare ſhe would give her Children in it, it was her conſtant anſwer, that ſeeing ſhe had long expected the death of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was but Adminiſtrator of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that ſhe might reign in it, it was but reaſon that her Children ſhould wait for hers with ſo much the leſs impatience that ſhe was equally proprietary both of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and that they had no right but by her to either of the two Monarchies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres,</hi> who was ignorant of none of thoſe particulars, well foreſaw that the Queen could not be induced to reſign her rights; and to ſay the truth, though ſhe could have been prevailed upon to do it, yet it would have ſignified nothing, ſeeing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53255:183"/> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have judged it null, all that knew her being witneſſes of her civil incapacity of contracting. There was a neceſſity then of making application to the States of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> but in that <hi>Chievres</hi> foreſaw no leſs difficulty in reſpect of the three bodies of which they were compoſed: For on the one hand it concerned them not to condeſcend to a ſharing in their Sovereignty, which might give occaſion to an infinite number of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom accidents; and on the other hand there had no like caſe hapned ſince the Chriſtian Religion had been eſtabliſhed in <hi>Spain.</hi> The intereſt as to the Clergy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the three Maſteries of St. <hi>James, Callatrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara,</hi> which had been ſeized by the Catholick Kings <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> though their Predeceſſours had left them to the ordinary courſe, and the uſe of thoſe for whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. Theſe dignities the richeſt and moſt conſiderable in <hi>Spain</hi> next to the Royal, becauſe of the multitude of Commanderies they had the diſpoſal of, had as well as the Commanderies always been reckoned Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Revenues and Preferments; and they who were inveſted in them in that quality had place in the body of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and rendered it incomparably more powerful than the two other Eſtates. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it was but too probable that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53255:184"/> the deſign of the Catholick Kings in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating thoſe three great Maſteries, was in proceſs of time to ſeculariſe them, under pretext that they were no longer neceſſary after that the <hi>Moors</hi> had no more domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Spain.</hi> If that deſign were put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the Clergy leſſened to a half by ſo notable a retrenchment, would no more be reſpected in <hi>Spain,</hi> as it was wont to be, and would fall to be the laſt of the three Eſtates, from the firſt that it was before. If the Archduke ſucceeded to the Crowns of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> immediately after the death of his Maternal Grandfather, he would be powerful enough at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain the entire ſeculariſation of the three Orders: whereas if his Mother were inviolably maintained in her right of reigning fallen to her by Nature and Law, as it was known by experience that fools and mad people were long lived, ſo the Clergy would have time to ſollicite the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See that theſe Maſteries might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed into their Primitive State.</p>
            <p>The Nobility had loſt no leſs of their luſtre than the Clergy, and were no leſs ſollicitous to recover it. They had been more the Maſters than Subjects of their Kings before the Reign of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and there needs no more but to read their Hiſtory to be convinced that they oftener revolted againſt their Kings,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53255:184"/> than they had ſought againſt the <hi>Moors.</hi> But they had been ſince conſtrained to ſhew their Inferiours an example of an implicite ſubmiſſion to their Sovereigns; and their condition in that particular was become like to that of the meaneſt Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, though they had made it their glory to be diſtinguiſhed from them principally in that they would ſecurely revolt, and that others always bore the puniſhment of their rebellion. In fine, the people had been exceedingly burdened under the late Reign. He foreſaw that the Archduke would not eaſe them, ſeeing he would flatter himſelf with the glory of proſecuting the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns of his Maternal Grandfather: whereas ſeeing all that was required of <hi>Spain</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Jane,</hi> was to maintain it ſelf, the ordinary Revenues of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> would be ſufficient for that Princeſs; and beſides, they who ſhould govern in her name would rather receive the Law from the Eſtates, than the Eſtates from them.</p>
            <p>The pretext was not a little plauſible of refuſing the Royalty to the Archduke, ſeeing it would be taken from the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of the two Monarchies, which ſo preciſely called to the Crown the next Heir of the King deceaſed, that ſo long as that Heir lived it would be Treaſon to acknowledge a more remote for their
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53255:185"/> Monarch. The Laws in that reſpect made no diſtinction betwixt Sexes; and ſo the elder Brother and Siſter of <hi>Jane</hi> were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53255:186"/> of the Archduke his Grandſon; and that he ought the more willingly to contribute to it, that what was deſired of him was only a bare Title. That it was to be feared that the Archduke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frequent calls to go from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> if he were no more but Governour of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> for the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> impatient at his too frequent abſence, might chuſe another Governour, who might in the ſequel take meaſures for changing his Dignity into that of a Monarch. That there were but too many inſtances of the like attempt in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the only way to avoid it, was to bind by a ſolemn Oath the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Archduke as ſoon as poſſible, and to oblige them preſently to own him for their King; becauſe no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> being more jealous of their Reputation than that People, and leſs able to endure to be upbraided with the violation of a publick Oath, they would be true to that which they made to the Archduke, what occaſion ſoever he might give them by his ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves. That in all times it belonged to Emperors to adjuſt the Titles of other Chriſtian Soveraigns; and that it would not be thought ſtrange if his Imperial
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53255:186"/> Majeſty made uſe of that right in relation to the Archduke. That in the mean time his example would paſs for a Law all over <hi>Europe;</hi> and that other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates would not refuſe to give the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke the Title of King, when they ſaw that the Emperor had done ſo.</p>

The rumor of it preſently flew all over <hi>Europe;</hi> but other Soveraigns refuſed to imitate the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, becauſe it was not his Court then that the Reputation of Princes iſſued from, or that diſtributed the Titles of Honour which were due unto them, and that many Ages were already paſt ſince the Holy See was in Poſſeſſion of that Prerogative. <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſenſible of the neceſſity of that, and in the ſecond place addreſt himſelf to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. He knew that his Holineſs was extreamly vexed that the <hi>French</hi> had recovered the Dutchy
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53255:187"/> of <hi>Milan</hi> the Year before, One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Five Hundred and Fifteen, and that he ſought for an occaſion to drive them thence, as <hi>Julius</hi> his Predeceſſor had done. <hi>Chievres</hi> his Agents thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repreſented to him, that the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his deſign depended ſolely on the greatneſs of the Archduke; and that if that Prince were in poſſeſſion of the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting the death of his Mother, he would be in a condition to help the Holy See to purge <hi>Italy</hi> of the <hi>French:</hi> Whereas if he were neceſſitated to follow the courſe of Nature, either he would not at all be King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Brother wanting neither Inclination nor Friends to ſupplant him; or it would be ſo late, that the <hi>French</hi> would in the mean time have more than enough of time ſo to fortifie themſelves in the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> that it would be impoſſible after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to get them out of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of <hi>Chievres</hi> appeared to the Pope ſo ſolid, that he wrote to the Archduke, exhorting him to take the Title of Catholick King, and gave it him. There remained a third ſtep which <hi>Chievres</hi> found to be incomparably more difficult than the former two. It ſtood upon the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s giving the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53255:187"/> the Title of King immediately after the Imperial Court and that of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe if it had been demanded before of other Courts, and that they had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were not very inclinable to grant it, would take that pretext for their excuſe. Neither was it neceſſary in deſiring that favour to give them ground to think that it depended wholly on them, becauſe they would have drawn their advantage from that; and if once they refuſed it, there was no after attempt to be uſed, and there would have been a neceſſity to wait till the death of Queen <hi>Jean.</hi> But there are few Cabinet affairs, which a Prudence refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by long Experience cannot unravel.</p>

               <hi>Chievres</hi> drew up a Letter ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and got the Archduke to ſign it, that on the one hand the Archduke inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated of what importance it was for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they ſhould give him the Title of King, yet without deſiring it or expoſing himſelf to a denial; and on the other hand, he ſo put them to it, that they could not excuſe themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting into compromiſe the thing in the world that was deareſt unto them, which was the Glory of their Monarchy. He inſinuated at firſt into their minds, without abating any thing of his Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53255:188"/> and then acquainted them, that his Grandfather the Emperor and the Pope had repreſented to him, that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for the honour of God, for the eaſe of the Catholick Queen in the infirmity wherewith Divine Majeſty had thought fit to viſit her: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> and for preventing the deſigns of their Enemies, that he ſhould preſently joyntly with his Mother, take the name of King, and diſcharge the duties of it: That he had put an extream violence upon himſelf, <note place="margin">Amongſt the Letters of <hi>Charles</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </note> in conſenting to it; and that he had not yielded to the importunities of the two Heads of the Chriſtian Religion, for the Spiritual and Temporal, till after he was convinced of the Maxim which Queen <hi>Iſabelle</hi> his Grandmother had ſo often in her mouth, <note place="margin">Los Reyes no tienen parien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> 
               <hi>That thoſe who were called to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of People had no Kindred:</hi> That he was willing to acquaint the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with it, not that he thought he needed their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but becauſe he knew that his conduct in that particular would not be unacceptable to them, and that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to find them in a perfect ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:53255:188"/>
            <p>The Letter was ſent to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> with orders to communicate it to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> after he had taken ſuch neceſſary cautions as might hinder them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exaſperated by it; but the Cardinal perceived at firſt that the words, <hi>joyntly with the Queen,</hi> which were inſerted in it, were only a cloak for the ambition of the Archduke; ſeeing it was certain, that ſo ſoon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had owned and ſworn to him as King, all the ſhare of Royalty that he would leave to the Queen his Mother, would only be to put her Name with his own to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of publick Acts, and in all things elſe he would Reign as abſolutely as if he had no Mother at all. That ſo no ſooner would he have ſet his Foot in <hi>Spain,</hi> but that the adminiſtration of <hi>Ximenes</hi> would entirely ceaſe, &amp; no greater part be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the affairs of State, than what he had during the Reign of the late King, from the time that he had refuſed to reſign his Archbiſhoprick. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that he foreſaw that he ſhould immediately die after the arrival of that young Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Profeſſors of the Univerſity of <hi>Alcala,</hi> who have written his Life, ſuſpect; or that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſuch another thought, as that of the famous <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Mother of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53255:189"/> 
               <hi>Nero,</hi> that ſhe cared not though it coſt her her life, provided her Son Reigned, he approved of the Letter which tended to his depoſition; and that he might compleat his victory over himſelf, he employed all his credit with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> that it might obtain the effect which <hi>Chievres</hi> expected from it. Wherein it cannot be ſufficiently admired, that this Prelate, who had acted ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts for gaining an unlimited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority during a Regency of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and for maintaining himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of all when once he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it; could ſo eaſily, and without conſtraint become in a trice ſo unlike to himſelf, as to conſent to a Recognition which he foreſaw muſt reduce him to a private condition; and which is worſe, to make himſelf the Solicitor of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that it could never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but by his means. All that can be ſaid of it is, that as there never was any machine which hath not ſometimes been out of order, or at leaſt whoſe ſprings that put it in motion, have not at ſome time been unbended; ſo neither is there any Humane prudence which by invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary irregularities that now and then eſcape it, does not in ſpight of it ſelf ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der homage to the wiſdom of God,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53255:189"/> which is ſo much the more eminently above that of Man, as that it is always uniform in its conduct. <hi>Ximenes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Archdukes Letter to the States of <hi>Spain,</hi> with all the circumſpection that makes the moſt difficult affairs ſucceed. He made uſe of the Counſellor of State, <hi>Carvaial</hi> mentioned before, who by a premeditated diſcourſe maintained in the Aſſembly, that the Archduke demanded nothing that was unjuſt or new. The firſt part of his Propoſition he proved by the extraordinary high parts, whereof that young Prince had given ſo many marks, and by his Education, which had rendred him at ſixteen years of age as capable of Reigning as the ableſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who have governed at a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age. He touched only by the bye at the infirmity of Queen <hi>Jean,</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſaid enough to inſinuate that her diſtemper was incurable; and that by conſequent there was ground more than enough to look upon that Princeſs as if ſhe were no more in Being, though ſhe were ſtill alive, and in appearance like long to continue ſo. He farther added, That it was more to be feared that her folly would degenerate into madneſs and fury, than it was to be hoped that it would leſſen with age. Thereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53255:190"/> to oblige his Auditors to make this Concluſion, That the unfortunate Queen was civilly Dead; and that in reſpect of her, the ſame meaſures were to be taken, as if <hi>Spain</hi> had already loſt her. The ſecond part of the diſcourſe of <hi>Carvaial</hi> was grounded chiefly upon an example taken out of the ancient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſeemed exactly to quadrate with the caſe in queſtion, though to ſpeak the truth, it was much diſguiſed. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Seventh, King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> had been by the Eſtates put in poſſeſſion, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for King of both the Kingdoms, in the life-time of Queen <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom they belonged. They who were throughly acquainted with the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> might have replied to <hi>Carvaial,</hi> that he was not very knowing in the Politicks of his Country, or that he impudently abuſed the honour which the chief Heads of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> did him in liſtening to his diſcourſe: For Queen <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca</hi> was only a fool in her love, and acted only by that principle, that is to ſay, like a woman who had wholly renounced modeſty. She entertained in ſight, and to the extream vexation of her Subjects, a ſimple Gentleman called <hi>Don Pedro de Lara:</hi> She had got her ſelf to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53255:190"/> be unmarried; that ſhe might live with him in all licentiouſneſs: She had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to her ſelf to raiſe him to the Throne in excluſion of her own Son <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> and the misfortune of that young Prince, who had deſerved no ſuch thing, and who beſides was of Age and very capable of Reigning, had wrought upon the Eſtates of the Country. They met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for preſerving the Crown for him; and ſeeing they could not do it, but by dividing the Royal Authority betwixt his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him, <note place="margin">In the Hiſtory of <hi>Urraca</hi> by <hi>Moralez.</hi>
               </note> becauſe if ſhe had retained it wholly, ſhe would have infallibly made uſe of it to oppreſs <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> they acknowledged him for King joyntly with her.</p>
            <p>There was nothing like to this in the affair of the Archduke in the manner as <hi>Carvaial</hi> had ſtated it. Queen <hi>Jean</hi> thought ſo little of fruſtrating him of the Succeſſion, that in her greateſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies ſhe never failed when ſhe ſpake of him, to call him Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> that is to ſay, that ſhe acknowledged him to be her only next lawful Heir; and though ſhe had had a mind to diſappoint him, it was evident ſhe could not do it, her diſtemper not ſuffering her to diſpoſe of her ſelf, and far leſs of her Crowns. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53255:191"/> ſhe had till then led a life without reproach, and her folly hindered her not from being ſtill a pattern of Chaſtity. The ſad condition ſhe was in ſpoke elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enough in her favours to oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to preſerve to her the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies that were fallen to her by the Succeſſions of her Father and Mother; and to take it ſtrictly, they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves from doing ſo, without committing a great injuſtice, ſeeing by owning the Archduke for King during the life of his Mother, they put him actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in poſſeſſion of a right, which by the conſent of all civilized Nations, did not belong to him till after the death of that Princeſs.</p>
            <p>So that neither the factions of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, nor the reaſons of <hi>Carvaial</hi> were ſufficient to render the Archdukes party the ſtronger. The Admiral of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> declared openly, that it was not in their power to grant the Archduke what he demanded: That twelve years ago, upon the death of Queen <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> they had received and ſworn Allegiance to <hi>Jean</hi> her eldeſt Daughter as their only Sovereign: That it would be a violation of their Oath to make her eldeſt Son her Colleague, who was not to Reign till after her death,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53255:191"/> and would furniſh Hiſtorians an ample ground of blackening their memory: That the Archduke had gone too far in taking of himſelf the title of King; and that if the Queen recovered her health, Nature might very well make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, without any neceſſity of a Foreign mediation or interceſſion: But if the chief men of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him in that exceſs of boldneſs, they run the risk of being abandoned by himſelf, and by conſequent of being lookt upon as Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Villena</hi> ſtarted a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Opinion more politick than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and more proper for avoiding than reſolving the difficulty. He ſaid, that ſeeing the Archduke did not demand their counſel, he thought it not fit that they ſhould give it him, nor that they ſhould expoſe themſelves to the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience juſt before mentioned. The firſt of the two Opinions appeared to be ſo juſt, and the ſecond ſo ſafe, that the one or other of them had infallibly prevailed in the Aſſembly, if the Cardinal, who foreſaw it, had not put in practice a piece of boldneſs that ſucceeded with him. He interrupted the courſe of Voting, and told them that it was not the caſe in hand to deliberate about a thing to be done,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53255:192"/> but to approve of a matter already done. That if the Archduke had done him the honour to have propoſed to him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which he had of taking the title of King, he would perhaps have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſwade him from it; but ſince he had proceeded in it without communicating any thing of it to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their glory and intereſt were equally concerned, not to make a young Prince, born to be their Maſter, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous upon his firſt entry into the World, ſeeing he was bred up in the beſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ever were for enlarging one day the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. That to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to quit the name and enſigns of Royalty when once he had taken them, would draw upon him the contempt of all the Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> render him the object of their ſcorn, ſpoil his credit with them as long as he lived; and ſo baulk his courage, that he would not dare for the future to undertake any thing, either for invading or reſiſting an Enemy. That he, <hi>Ximenes</hi> himſelf, thought it fit to take the Aſſembly off from committing a miſtake, by inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of that moſt important Truth, that in that juncture there was no mean betwixt taking from the Archduke the title of King, and declaring him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53255:192"/> incapable of Reigning one day in <hi>Spain</hi> when it came to his turn; and that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſo imprudent, as to make the firſt of thoſe two ſteps in relation to him, it would be impoſſible for them to clear themſelves of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and not to ſubmit hereafter to the rule of a Prince, whom they had ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully degraded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> having ſpoken in ſo poſitive a ſtrain, gave not them the time of taking the Votes. He ſternly commanded <hi>Don Pedro Correa,</hi> his intimate friend, whom he had made Corregidor of <hi>Madrid,</hi> To go and proclaim through the Town Queen <hi>Jean</hi> and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> her Son joyntly Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> The Corregidor, who was one of the Aſſembly, and who apparently had put all things in a readineſs for execution of the orders which he had received, went out immediately, and ſoon after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Proclamation was heard. The Deputies, who had not as yet given their Votes, ſeeing that if they ſpake againſt what was actually a doing, they would inſtantly occaſion a Civil War, for which they and their relations muſt be accountable, approved the Cardinals diſcourſe, and the Orders that he had given.</p>
            <pb n="368" facs="tcp:53255:193"/>
            <p>Thus the boldeſt project that hath happened in the memory of man, <note place="margin">In the act of Proclamation.</note> was brought about with little intrigue, and without any oppoſition; and the Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> gave account of it to the new Catholick King, whom hereafter we ſhall name <hi>Charles,</hi> and to <hi>Chievres,</hi> without robbing <hi>Ximenes</hi> of the praiſe he merited by it. Both of them were ſo well ſatisfied with it, that they heartily pardoned that Cardinal for all that had diſpleaſed them in his former conduct; and all the buſineſs in <hi>Flanders</hi> was the haſtening of <hi>Charles</hi> his voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> for taking poſſeſſion of the Kingdoms he now was inſtalled in. They foreſaw but one impediment to it, which concerned the Treaty concluded with <hi>France</hi> by the miniſtry of the Count of <hi>Naſſau.</hi> It hath been ſaid before, that <hi>Charles,</hi> when as yet but Archduke, had engaged himſelf to reſtore the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> to the moſt Chriſtian King, and to <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> ſo ſoon as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King his Grandfather were dead. The condition was come, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Bruxelles</hi> preſſed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof. There was no pretext of delaying the reſtitution of the two Crowns, ſeeing if <hi>Charles</hi> did not
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53255:193"/> reſolve to do it willingly, and frankly to perform his promiſe, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt was in a better condition to force him to it by way of Arms, than ever he had been before, or perhaps, than ever he could be for the future. He had at the field of <hi>Warignan</hi> quelled the inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pride of the <hi>Swiſſe;</hi> and forced that warlike Nation, who thought they could domineer over Kings, to make peace with him as he himſelf had deſired. He had recovered the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> from <hi>Maximilian Sforza.</hi> He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed himſelf in that Conqueſt in the year One Thouſand Five Hundred and Sixteen, by the utter overthrow of that formidable Army which the Emperor had led in perſon into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> The Forces of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, which he had oppoſed againſt that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ſtill on foot; and it would have been eaſie for him to have taken <hi>Flanders,</hi> by cauſing them to march thither as ſoon as <hi>Charles</hi> were gone. In the mean time his Catholick Majeſty was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ward ſo dangerous a blow. He had no more Soldiers than were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his Convoy in his voyage to <hi>Spain;</hi> and the <hi>Flemings</hi> would not have aſſiſted him in levying of more, if they ſhould have known that he only needed them for
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53255:194"/> maintaining the uſurpations of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre.</hi> So they would have been expoſed to the invaſions of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Charles</hi> would have loſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more than the two Crowns we laſt named were worth. Nevertheleſs, in the juncture that then happened, he could not reſtore them, nor ſo much as pretend it was his intention, without entirely forfeiting the Succeſſion of his Mother: For if he had attempted of his own Authority, and without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Monarchies to which the two Kingdoms were annexed, to write to the Viceroys to reſtore them, they would not have obeyed him; and if by Proxy he had demanded the conſent of the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtille</hi> for the reſtitution of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the approbation of the Eſtates of <hi>Arragon</hi> for rendring <hi>Naples</hi> It would not only have been denied him, but more, the two Monarchies would have joyned in an intereſt common to both, and paſſed immediately from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to a Revolt. There was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity then of waiting till the Catholick King were in poſſeſſion of his Kingdoms of <hi>Spain;</hi> and till he had taken ſuch juſt meaſures for the Reſtitutions in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as might aſſure him of ſucceſs; and upon ſo well grounded reaſons <hi>Chievres</hi>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:53255:194"/> wrote to <hi>Gouffier,</hi> great Maſter of the Houſhold to the moſt Chriſtian King, That it was abſolutely neceſſary for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving peace betwixt the two young Kings, whom they had had the honour to Educate, that they ſhould have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together; and that they ſhould adjuſt a Treaty ſo advantageous to their Maſters, that neither of them might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but only to put in execution what was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal terms reſolved upon: That the honour of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt was concerned in the ſpeedineſs of the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and that if it was deferred, the delay would be imputed to the weakneſs of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and by conſequence would redound to his ſhame: That the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> had both been Uſurped, the firſt by the Infidelity, and the ſecond by the Jugling of the late King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that the matter was ſo evident, that no man in all <hi>Europe</hi> doubted of it, what care ſoever that cunning Prince had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to dazle the eyes of the World by
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53255:195"/> Manifeſto's ſtuft with Falſhoods, and the diſcourſes of his Agents: That it was enough to <hi>France</hi> that <hi>Naples</hi> was directly Uſurped from them, and that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> had loſt <hi>Navarre</hi> upon the only conſideration that he would not break with <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, to make them with equal zeal ſolicite, that the firſt of the two laſt mentioned Kingdoms ſhould be reſtored to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſecond to his Ally; and that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no appearance that <hi>France</hi> could be in a better condition for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than it was then in for recovering them, nor that the Catholick King could be in a worſe ſtate for maintaining them by the way of Arms, as wanting both men and money; <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt would be for ever blamed if he let ſlip ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an occaſion, and <hi>Gouffier</hi> would in Hiſtory paſs for a notorious Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, if he contributed to it in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres,</hi> who had no ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to make directly to ſuch ſolid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, thought it enough to reply indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that the King his Maſter had the beſt and moſt ſincere intentions in the World as to the matter in hand; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew him better than any man elſe, he ought more to be credited than
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53255:196"/> thoſe who might have inſinuated contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts into his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: But that Sovereigns as well as other men were liable to neceſſities; and that that to which <hi>Charles</hi> was then redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced was the more excuſable in that it was extream. That it was true indeed, he had fallen to a very large Succeſſion: but that it would wholly eſcape him, if it were not managed with all imaginable care and induſtry: That <hi>Navarre</hi> lay ſo very conveniently for the Monarchies of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> that they had no cauſe of fear from abroad, but from thence, and that the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the two Seas ſecured them on all other hands: That as their Enemies being Maſters of <hi>Navarre</hi> could preſently bring whole Armies into the heart of their Countries, ſo without that they could but weakly attack their Frontiers: That, to judge things aright, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> was of no leſs importance to them, ſeeing if they loſt it, they were certain not to keep <hi>Sicily</hi> long: That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs that was the Kingdom from whence <hi>Spain</hi> had Corn in the frequent ſcarcities to which it was ſubject; and that theſe two motives would be enough to engage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, if their new King obliged them
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53255:196"/> preſently to reſtore <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre:</hi> That it would be thought ſtranger, that he ſhould meddle in ſo nice an Affair up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his coming to the Crown, in that he was a ſtranger: That during the ſpace of a Thouſand years <hi>Spain</hi> had not been governed by Monarchs of that kind: That they had never as yet ſeen <hi>Charles;</hi> and that hardly any thing could make them endure that an abſent ſtranger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had taken poſſeſſion of his Crowns, ſhould cut them ſhort by two: That before any ſuch thing was attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, an infinite number of cautions muſt be taken, and that he muſt begin the work by obtaining from the Eſtates an unlimited Authority: That afterward a powerful Faction ſhould be formed in the three Bodies which make up his Eſtates, for diſpoſing them to give an entire ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the moſt Chriſtian King: And that in fine, when the Catholick King were once aſſured of obtaining what he deſired by propoſing it, the matter ſhould be varniſhed over with ſo plauſible colours, that if it were not frankly conſented to, yet at leaſt it ſhould paſs in Form, and without Sedition: That the Catholick King expected an happy ſucceſs in this, provided he were ſuffered to take his own way in Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53255:197"/> it, and that <hi>Chievres</hi> durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for it upon two conditions; one that his Maſter were allowed time to go to <hi>Spain,</hi> and there to diſpoſe the minds of the People; and the other that the promiſe of reſtoring in convenient time the two Kingdoms to the moſt Chriſtian King, and <hi>John d' Albert</hi> ſhould be kept ſo ſecret, that no <hi>Spaniard</hi> might dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſe of <hi>Chievres,</hi> if rightly taken, was captious, ſeeing he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a preſent and moſt important favour, ſuch as the ſecurity of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> during the abſence of <hi>Charles,</hi> for hopes ſo much the more uncertain, that the fulfilling of them was remote, and would abſolutely depend upon the faithfulneſs of his Catholick Majeſty, who having obtained beforehand all that he could have deſired, perhaps would not take much care of performing his promiſe. Nevertheleſs, whether it was that <hi>Gouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier</hi> did not ſufficiently reflect upon that, or that he yielded to the importunities of inferiour Miniſters, who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Negotiate under him, whom <hi>Chievres</hi> had charmed with his careſſes; the Court of <hi>France</hi> committed an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable fault, and ſuffered themſelves to be chouſed by a man whom then they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53255:197"/> had but too great ground to diſtruſt. They conſented that <hi>Gouffier</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> ſhould confer together about finding out an expedient that might a little more bind the Catholick King, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs leave him as much liberty as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for diſpoſing his new Subjects to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>France.</hi> Several were propoſed; and that which the two Plenipotentiaries at length agreed upon, was, that there ſhould be two Treaties of <hi>Noyon</hi> of the ſame date; one which ſhould be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret by the Parties concerned, until the time of its execution; and another which ſhould be made publick ſo ſoon as it was ſigned. By the firſt, <note place="margin">In the two Treaties of <hi>Noyon.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> obliged himſelf not to loſe any time in the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> after he had taken poſſeſſion of his maternal Crowns; and to do it himſelf by his own abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if he could not obtain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the ſecond only contained, that the moſt Chriſtian and Catholick Kings ſhould agree upon Arbitrators, who within a prefixed time ſhould declare, whether the Crowns of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtille</hi> had any right or not to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre.</hi> That if theſe Arbitrators decided in favour of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:53255:198"/> the two Kingdoms ſhould remain united to it; and that if their Sentence were to the diſadvantage thereof, the Catholick King ſhould inſtantly reſtore them.</p>
            <p>The other Articles of the two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in all things alike, which may have given occaſion to think that there was but one. The three moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were, that until the Arbitrators ſhould decide to which of the two, <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Catholick King ſhould pay to the moſt Chriſtian King one hundred thouſand Crowns a year as a quit-Rent: That the Catholick King ſhould eſpouſe <hi>Loviſia</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was yet but a year old; and that if that young Princeſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Marriage were conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Catholick King ſhould Marry another of the moſt Chriſtian King's Daughters, in caſe he had more; and that if he had none, the Marriage of the Catholick King with <hi>Renee</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Siſter-in-law to his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſhould be accompliſhed, as it was agreed upon in the former Treaty: That in fine, the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſhould reſtore to the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> the City of <hi>Verona</hi> with this caution, that he ſhould put it into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who ſhould immediately after
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53255:198"/> deliver it over to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and that the Senate of that Republick ſhould pay to the Emperor two hundred thouſand Crowns, to reimburſe the charges he had been at in Conquering that City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gouffier</hi> in this matter concluded the Treaty of <hi>Noyon;</hi> and Politicians judged that he loſt in it as much reputation as <hi>Chievres</hi> had acquired. And truly if we may judge of the ſatisfaction of the two Kings, with their Plenipotentiaries, by the reward which they gave them; it is certain on the one hand, that <hi>Gouffier</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived none of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; and on the other, that <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by <hi>Charles,</hi> that he became the richeſt Subject in Chriſtendom. <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt and <hi>Philip</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given him the forfeiture of the Eſtate of the houſe of <hi>Gaure,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Nivelle,</hi> the Collar of the Golden Fleece, the great Bailliage of <hi>Haynault,</hi> and two thouſand Crowns for his extraordinary Embaſſy in <hi>France</hi> in the year One Thouſand Five Hundred and One, where he had made himſelf known to <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, according to his value, though there was nothing concluded in the Peace which he went to Negotiate betwixt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick

               </gap> never Prince was ſo well ſerved as he was, and by conſequence was obliged to give ſo many Rewards as he: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe <hi>Chievres,</hi> as hath been obſerved before, never begg'd any thing of him, neither for himſelf nor his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53255:199"/> and thought it enough to deſerve from a grateful Prince the Favours that he heaped upon him.</p>
            <p>Seeing the accommodation of <hi>Noyon</hi> had ſurmounted all the obſtacles that could obſtruct <hi>Charles</hi> in taking poſſeſſion of his maternal Eſtates, he had not ſo great cauſe any more to fear the exceſs of Authority which Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> took to himſelf in <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> was of the opinion, that he ſhould be let alone to do ſo, provided his actions ſtruck neither directly nor indirectly at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantages of his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. The Cardinal on his ſide vied in gratitude; and ſerved <hi>Charles</hi> with as great application, as if he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him for the Regency. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Grandees of <hi>Caſtille</hi> to receive his Orders, and to execute them with as much expedition and ſubmiſſion, as if they had had their King in the midſt of <hi>Spain;</hi> and ſeeing he foreſaw that thoſe Grandees, who had a deſign to revolt, could find but two plauſible pretexts for ſo doing, one upon account of the Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> and the other on the part of the <hi>Infanta;</hi> he cauſed both to be ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerved, and yet treated them ſo civilly, that he took from them no leſs the occaſions of attempting againſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53255:200"/> his adminiſtration, than the grounds of complaining of him.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved, that Queen <hi>Germana de Foix</hi> was not tempted with ambition, and coveted no more, but to live pleaſantly, and without trouble, in Feaſting and Dancing. The late Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King left her at his death by a Codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, fifty thouſand Ducats of Rent, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her Dowry) aſſigned upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and if ſhe had not been punctually paid it, the <hi>Arrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> would have taken it ill, as an affront done to the memory of their Hereditary King, and have revenged themſelves by raiſing troubles in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> or by fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe which they found raiſed there to their hand. In the mean time King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> on the one hand had left the Royal Treaſury empty; and on the other the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> as affairs ſtood then, was not able to pay the Catholick Queen the Summ that it was Rated at; becauſe the <hi>French</hi> having marched into <hi>Italy</hi> for the recovery of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan, Raimond</hi> of <hi>Cardonna,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> was apprehenſive that they might march next againſt him, and that he might not be ſurpriſed, had made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary levies of Soldiers, which had drained not only the Revenues of the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53255:200"/> Crown, but alſo the purſes of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons who had been willing to lend him money. The queſtion was, how all theſe Creditors ſhould be payed; and if it had not been done with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, conſidering the juncture of a minority, they would not have failed to have riſen. All that <hi>Spain</hi> had from <hi>Naples</hi> was ſet apart for their re-imburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> as bold as he was, durſt not have employed ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a Fund for other uſes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Queen importuned him to be payed quarterly; and the only expedient he found to ſatisfie her, was to pay her with his own money, upon aſſurances which <hi>Chievres</hi> ſent him under the hand of the Catholick King, that what he laid out for his Majeſty upon that account, ſhould be faithfully repaid him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infanta</hi> put the Cardinal to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble, becauſe he was ſtill poſſeſſed with a fancy, that he ſhould one day Reign in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and that others labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feed him in that conceit. Whilſt he was a hunting, an Apparition had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf before him in the ſhape of a Hermit, which told him as from God, that he ſhould be Monarch of all <hi>Spain,</hi> and preſently diſappeared, having left him in an anxious expectation of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53255:201"/> His Viſion he had communicated to the Marqueſs <hi>Denia</hi> his Governour, and to the Biſhop <hi>Alvaro Oſorio</hi> his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and as men eaſily believe what they deſire, and are not undeceived but very late, ſo the Governour and Tutor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves the chief Dignities of <hi>Spain</hi> upon that idle Prediction. Their whimſey was not the leſs durable for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ill grounded; and neither the laſt Will of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> nor the publick recognition of the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> as King by the Eſtates of both Monarchies, were ſufficient to undeceive them. They conſtantly ſolicited <hi>Ximenes</hi> to give them leave to carry back the <hi>Infanto</hi> to the Town of <hi>Simancas,</hi> appointed for his Education; and though this Cardinal did not as yet foreſee their real deſign, yet he ſuſpected it, and plainly told them that the perſon of the <hi>Infanto</hi> was ſo dear to him, that there might be fault found with his adminiſtration, if he let him go out of his ſight. It was ſoon after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that his diſtruſt was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; and that it was the intention of the chief Officers of the <hi>Infanto</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at <hi>Simancas</hi> the favourable juncture which Heaven had promiſed, and in the mean time to engage into the parties of that young Princes as many of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53255:201"/> as poſſibly they could, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering themſelves too much: The Spies whom the Cardinal entertained about them, informed him of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Marqueſs and Biſhop; and in all appearance it was to make ſuch reports continue, that he long detained the <hi>Infanto</hi> at <hi>Madrid</hi> under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts. But when he would no longer amuſe him, he told him plainly, that his preſence was ſo neceſſary for the publick good, that he would not abſent himſelf from the place where the Council of State was kept, without diſobliging the Catholick King his Brother. When he thus ſpake, he obſerved the looks of the Marqueſs and Biſhop; and perceiving that it put them to extream pain, he took meaſures to prevent the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s being carried away from him. The cautions that he uſed were ſo quaint, that this young Prince and his Servants were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint without perceiving it.</p>
            <p>So that there being no more danger from the two chief perſons of the State; the Cardinal in the following manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into order the moſt conſiderable of the Grandees. This was <hi>Don Pedro Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Carero,</hi> called the <hi>Deuff,</hi> who had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a long intriegue to get himſelf choſen Great Maſter of the Order of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53255:202"/> 
               <hi>S. James</hi> after the death of King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the motives of the diſgrace of the Great Captain.</note> He was Brother to the Duke of <hi>Eſcalone,</hi> and an intimate friend of the Great Captain <hi>Gonſalvo,</hi> who had made him privy to the Bulls which heretofore he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, for that Maſtery, in caſe he out-lived the Catholick King. The Great Captain dying before his Majeſty, <hi>Porto Carero</hi> ſuppoſed that ſeeing the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had granted <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> the Bulls we have been mentioning, it appeared that that Court had a deſign by all means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite thoſe three great Maſteries from the Crown of <hi>Caſtille;</hi> and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſuch a favour having been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not ſo much in conſideration of the particular merit of him that had obtained it, as for fear of rendering the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> too powerful, <hi>Porto Carero</hi> had ground to hope for it, though his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal qualities came not near thoſe of the Great Captain. He had credit at the Court of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth; and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it ſo dexterouſly, that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Holineſs Bulls conform to thoſe which had been granted by <hi>Julius,</hi> but upon condition ſtill not to make uſe of them till after the death of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:53255:202"/> He had not as yet received them when his Catholick Majeſty died, but a few days after they arrived; and there being no juncture more favourable to him, than the diviſion betwixt the Cardinal and the Governours of the <hi>Infanto;</hi> he wrote to all the Commanders of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to meet in the City of <hi>Compoſtella</hi> in <hi>Galicia,</hi> there to hold a Chapter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him in quality of Great Maſter, conform to the Bulls ſent him from the Pope. The chief Commanders were his Kinſmen or Allies; and beſides, it was ſo much their intereſt, that the Great Maſtery ſhould be cut off from the Crown, that they made no ſcruple to obey him, ſeeing in that caſe there was none of them who might not hope to be raiſed to it, either by merit or faction: whereas they muſt all be fruſtrated, if it continued united to the Crown.</p>
            <p>However the Aſſembly could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that the Cardinal had notice of it; and ſince there was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of carrying high to chaſtize the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Porto Carero,</hi> or not at all to meddle in it; he ſent the <hi>Alcaide Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanno</hi> with Forces to put a ſtop to the Chapter by fair means or foul. The Commanders, who were not prepared to fight, ſeparated ſo ſoon as the <hi>Alcaide</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:53255:203"/> had ſignified to them the Orders of the Cardinal; and pretended to ſubmit wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to the Authority which they would not have regarded, if it had been unarmed. The Cardinal having ſent them back to their ſeveral Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, cauſed them to be ſo narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved there, that it was impoſſible for them afterwards to meet again, till the new Catholick King had obtained from the Pope the three great Maſteries, as vacant by the death of his Grandfather. But the counter-blows in Politicks are ſometimes more dangerous than the blows.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>Caſtille</hi> took it ill that the Cardinal had ſo imperiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed the Aſſembly of <hi>Galicia,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him for having in that particular uſurped a power which was not given him, neither by the Teſtament of the late King, nor by the Laws of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy whereof he was the Regent. The Grandees made it a point of honour, not to ſuffer the continuance of a proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo unſuitable to a Prieſt and Monk, and took the firſt occaſion that they found to ſhake off a yoke which they called Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical. The occaſion was this, It had come into <hi>Ximenes</hi> his mind at an unſeaſonable time, to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53255:203"/> of three abuſes, which in all likelihood ought to have been born with in the abſence of the Sovereign, if the Maxims of common Politicks had been followed. The firſt was of ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Court, who by favour had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an augmentation of their Salaries: the ſecond of Penſions granted to Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> who were known not to be deſerving, or not to have merited them by honeſt courſes; and the third conſiſted in recovering Crown Lands that had been alienated, upon occaſion of the Conqueſts of <hi>Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before <hi>Ximenes</hi> put his deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he had demanded the advice of <hi>Chievres,</hi> who counſelled him to ſtay till the Catholick King were come into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille:</hi> But whether it was that he thought himſelf ſtrong enough to bring about ſo bold a project without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Maſter, or that he imagined <hi>Chievres</hi> envied him the glory which he might thereby obtain; he went on ſtill with his work. He moderated at firſt, with pretty good ſucceſs, the new aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of Salaries; and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Spain</hi> were very well pleaſed with the reduction of Wages to the Ancient ſtandard, becauſe on the one hand the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53255:204"/> high Nobility had hardly any concern in that; and on the other, thoſe who were prejudiced by the Cardinals regulation, were ſatisfied to repine at it in ſecret. The retrenching of Penſions cauſed him more trouble, by reaſon that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring was more univerſal and more publick: But the recovery of the Crown Lands reached too high not to meet with terrible impediments at the very firſt ſtep. It was pretended that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King muſt not only enter again into the Lands ſold at an under-rate, or given in gratuities, but alſo into thoſe which the detainers could not make out to have been alienated by good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and for lawful cauſes. There were but few Lords of the high Nobility, who poſſeſſed not ſome of this nature; and if they had no favour ſhew'd them, it was almoſt certain they would be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Revolt. Nevertheleſs they were ſummoned as well as others, and a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough time aſſigned them for making good their Titles. The indignation that this wrought in them gave occaſion to <hi>Pedro Giron,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Count of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>regna,</hi> to think that the time was now come for recovering the Dutchy of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Sidonia,</hi> which he had been turned out of.</p>
            <pb n="391" facs="tcp:53255:204"/>
            <p>For underſtanding this Affair which raiſed all <hi>Spain</hi> almoſt, we muſt know that <hi>Don Juan de Guſman,</hi> Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia</hi> Eſpouſed in firſt marriage the eldeſt Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Bejar,</hi> by whom he had a Son called <hi>Henry,</hi> and a Daughter named <hi>Mentia: Henry</hi> was importent, and <hi>Mentia</hi> married to the Count of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>regna,</hi> had by him <hi>Pedro Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not long his firſt Wife, having loſt her the third year after their Marriage. He was ſtill young, and his firſt alliance had given him often occaſion of ſeeing the ſecond Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jar</hi> his Siſter-in-Law. He had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly much taken with her; and if the inclination that he had for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained within the bounds of a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſo long as he was married to her Siſter, it degenerated into love ſo ſoon as he became a Widower. He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction the richeſt Lord of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluſia,</hi> had lived very well with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife; offered to marry her Siſter upon the ſame conditions, that is to ſay, without a portion: The great men of <hi>Spain</hi> minded not much at that time the proximity of bloud in their Alliances; and the Duke of <hi>Bejar</hi> had a numerous Family. Theſe five conſiderations mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53255:205"/> 
               <hi>Bejar</hi> to condeſcend to accept of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia</hi> for his Son-in-Law a ſecond time; and ſeeing all ways were taken for obtaining a diſpenſation from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See in the moſt favourable Form that then was in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">In the Hiſtory of <hi>Medina Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.</hi>
               </note> it was at length gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Of the ſecond Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age he had a Son famous in Hiſtory, by the name of <hi>Alvaro de Guſman;</hi> and the Duke his Father bred him up as the next lawful Heir of his vaſt Eſtate, ſo ſoon as the impotency of <hi>Henry de Guſman,</hi> the only Son of his firſt Bed, came to be known. <hi>Alvaro</hi> grew to be ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed a Lord, that the Catholick King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> pitched upon him for a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> lawful Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> his Majeſtie's Natural Son: But there are few ſignal Inceſts amongſt Chriſtians, which whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape unpuniſhed till the other World; and God commonly begins in this by dreadful chaſtiſements, to ſhew his averſion to ſuch promiſcuous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which he only ſuffered in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, and for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Mankind. <hi>Pedro Giron,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Mentia,</hi> Daughter by the firſt Marriage to the Duke of <hi>Medina Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> claimed to be ſole and univerſal
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53255:205"/> Heir to his maternal Grandfather, and alledged for his reaſons, that <hi>Alvaro de Guſman</hi> his Uncle was illegitimate: that he was the odious off-ſpring of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous conjunction: That Divine and Humane Laws equally condemned the Marriage of two Siſters; and that if they had been ſometimes ſuffered in Chriſtian Religion, it was only for cauſes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the publick, certain and preſent good of the State, and Royal Perſons: That there was no ſuch thing in the caſe in queſtion, and that by conſequence the Diſpenſation obtained from <hi>Rome</hi> was null. But for all that the Catholick King gave his Grand-daughter to <hi>Alvaro Guſman,</hi> and made anſwer to thoſe who would have diſſwaded him from it, that it belonged not to <hi>Pedro Giron</hi> to quarrel at the Diſpenſation obtained by his Grandfather; and that though there might be ground to find fault with it, yet the preſence of his Majeſty and of the Queen <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> who ſigned the contract, had ſupplied all defects of Law and Fact that would have intervened.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> died ſometime after the Marriage of <hi>Alvaro</hi> his Son, who took poſſeſſion of all the Eſtate of the Family, without any other oppoſition than that of ſome proteſtations
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53255:206"/> in writing made in behalf of <hi>Pedro Giron.</hi> But after the death of the Catholick King; when <hi>Alvaro</hi> had loſt in him his greateſt ſupporter, <hi>Pedro Giron</hi> thought the time was come for him to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Eſtate of the Family of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia.</hi> He got of his Friends what money they thought fit to lend him: he implored the aſſiſtance of his neareſt Relations, his Father excuſing himſelf to engage in the quarrel, becauſe of his great Age: He found a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young men, who had known him in the Armies, diſpoſed to aſſiſt him; and from thoſe three ſtocks he procured For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enough to lay a regular Siege before <hi>St. Lucar,</hi> one of the moſt noted Towns of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> becauſe of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of its Harbour. Seeing it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to the Dukes of <hi>Medins Sidonia,</hi> and that it was part of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of their eldeſt Sons, which could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſold nor morgaged; the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> had no Garriſon in it, and only kept one in the Caſtle which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the place, nor had they done ſo, till firſt they gave the Dukes of <hi>Medina Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> authentick Declarations, that it was not for any pretenſions they had to it, but only for the ſecurity of the Coaſt of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> the moſt important of their

               </gap> known to be, there to continue till his Friends ſhould make his peace with <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> The cauſe of ſo odd an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was, becauſe moſt of the Beſiegers were Voluntiers, and only ſerved in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53255:207"/> hopes, as they were made believe, that the Cardinal would approve what they did. They knew him to be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily jealous of his Authority, and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable when once he had been conſtrained to come to force. From thence they concluded, that if the Beſiegers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, thoſe of them that remained would ſuffer by the hand of the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. By their ſmall number in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe who came to the aſſiſtance of Duke <hi>Alvaro,</hi> they judged that the match was not equal, and thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded themſelves, expecting till <hi>Pedro Giron</hi> could make his party ſtronger. They were not altogether miſtaken in their conjecture; and the Enemies of <hi>Ximenes</hi> laboured with ſo much applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſucceſs to make him receive an affront in the affair of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> that <hi>Giron</hi> thought, having got his Uncle the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and many other Grandees to League with him, that he had no more to fear, and that he might ſecurely brave the Cardinal. He went to <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſuppoſing that that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late extraordinarily nice in matter of offence, and eaſie to be provoked by ſlights offered to his Dignity, would ſend him Orders to be gone with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, &amp; thereby furniſh him with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53255:208"/> as he deſired, to complain of him. But the Cardinal, who ſaw into <hi>Giron</hi>'s thoughts, carried himſelf as if he had not known of his arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or as if he had not been concerned at it. He gave him time to try his patience; and <hi>Giron</hi> finding his firſt trick baffled by the affected inſenſibility of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſecond. He ſent word to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, that he was come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other deſign, but to viſit his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends, and that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn immediately after. He expected that the Cardinal would have replied to the Gentleman who brought him that word, That <hi>Giron</hi> was not ſo great a man, but that he might have come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and given him the firſt notice of his arrival: But the Cardinal diſſembled ſtill, and made no other reply but, <hi>In a good time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing ſo much diſpleaſes thoſe that ſeek for a quarrel, as a moderation pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed moſt unſeaſonably as to them, that is to ſay, at the time when they are moſt exaſperated. <hi>Giron</hi> whom <hi>Ximenes</hi> puniſhed more ſeverely by neglecting him than if he had put him in priſon, reſolved to have his turn, and to be even with him by a third way. He told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome, who he knew would acquaint
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53255:208"/> the Cardinal with it, the true cauſe why he had not gone to ſee that Prelate, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Catholick King and thoſe who had the honour to repreſent his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe the Grandees of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> as often as they paſſed by the place where their King was, were accuſtomed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him; and if they did ſo in reſpect of the Cardinal, the Catholick King might have cauſe to find fault with them for it. That was reported to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who wondering no more at that than at all the reſt, forced <hi>Giron</hi> to attack him in a fair way, by making a great party againſt him upon the old pretexts of diſcontent which the high Nobility had againſt him. The Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> was the firſt that engaged in it, becauſe there was a talk of taking from him a Royal right which he had upon the Coaſts of <hi>Andaluſia:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bonevento</hi> was drawn in next, out of ſpight, becauſe he had been hindered to finiſh a Fort which he had begun in the Territory of <hi>Cigalez:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Medina Coeli</hi> followed their example, becauſe of Rents which they had out of the Crown Lands; and the Biſhop of <hi>Signenſca</hi> was the fifth, upon the account that being born in <hi>Portugal,</hi> he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53255:209"/> to loſe his Biſhoprick lying in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> ſuppoſing the Cardinal might be inclined of himſelf, or might be deſired to re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of their faireſt Priviledges, which conſiſted in that neither their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices nor Benefices could be held by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>There remained no more to raiſe the other Heads of the high Nobility, but to gain the Duke of <hi>Infantado,</hi> the chief of the Family of <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> to whom the other Lords of <hi>Spain</hi> yielded in Birth, Eſtate, Riches and Merit. It ſeemed no difficult thing to diſpoſe him to a Revolt, by reaſon of what had paſſed betwixt <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and him. He had heretofore courted the Alliance of that Cardinal; and had offered to him notwithſtanding the extream diſproportion of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to marry <hi>Diego de Mendoſa</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Son with <hi>Iſabelle</hi> of <hi>Ciſnero,</hi> the Cardinals Niece. It is not known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the Duke was tempted with ambition, or that he only intended to unite more cloſely with that Favorite; or laſtly, if he acted in proſpect of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the vaſt Eſtates of his Family, by joyning thereto the great Treaſure which the Cardinal was thought to have, with his Heireſs: But it is certain that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53255:209"/> the Duke himſelf one day made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Cardinal; and that he ſurpriſed at the honour that was done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:53255:210"/> they perſiſted in the inſenſibility that at preſent they were in: That they had already ſuffered but too long a man of baſe birth, who had judged himſelf ſo incapable of commanding, that he had made a vow of obedience ſo long as he lived; and who having only learnt to govern in the Cloiſters where Authority is wholly abſolute, imagined that the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> were to be Ruled as abſolutely, as <hi>Cordeliers</hi> of the ſtricteſt obſervance: That if the power he took to himſelf had any ground in the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi> it ought to be ſubmitted unto; but that theſe Laws favoured not a Monk, who had only raiſed and did maintain himſelf by violating them: That he could ſhew no other title for his pretended Regency, but the Article of the laſt Will and Teſtament of the late Catholick King, which bequeathed it to him; but that there were three things to be found fault with in that Article, the leaſt whereof was ſufficient to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the execution thereof. Firſt, that it was ſuggeſted by <hi>Carvaial</hi> the Counſellor of State, to whom the Cardinal for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward had promiſed the Biſhoprick of <hi>Siguença,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had outed the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Prelate, who was provided to it contrary to the cuſtom of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53255:211"/> that the Cardinal ſtretched his power infinitely beyond what he ſaid was given him, which ſtood in need of no proof, ſeeing it was a thing ſo publick that no body was ignorant of it; and laſtly, that granting it were true, that the late Catholick King had granted him the Regency in the full extent that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed it in, yet he ought not to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enjoy it, ſeeing by the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the Royal Authority devolved upon the high Nobility during the time of minority or infirmity of their Kings, when they were of long continuance; and if the Nobility condeſcended that the late King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould retain the Government for life, yet it followed not that they had given him leave to diſpoſe of it after his death.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Infantado</hi> anſwered, that he had at leaſt as much ground to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Cardinal, as any other Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee of <hi>Caſtille;</hi> and that his Anceſtors having left him conſiderable Eſtates of that nature, which was pretended to be Lands of the Crown; by conſequence he had occaſion to be apprehenſive that they would begin at him in retrieving them, that others might think it the leſs ſtrange when they were diſpoſſeſſed
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53255:211"/> next, that no favour had been ſhown to the moſt conſiderable Lord of <hi>Spain.</hi> But that notwithſtanding he was not of the opinion that any thing ſhould be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in prejudice of the laſt Will of the late King, nor contrary to the orders of the Catholick King Reigning, though it was known that they were only provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional in what concerned <hi>Ximenes:</hi> That that Cardinal had more experience and more ready money than they; and that there was no doubt to be made, but that he would root them out altogether, if they gave him occaſion to put the people on his ſide, by letting them know that the Lords of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſtruck at the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late King, who had choſen him for Regent, and at the Authority of the new King, who had confirmed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency unto him: That it was then abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to find out another expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, than that of violence for degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him; and that when ſuch an one were found, the Duke of <hi>Infantado</hi> ſhould willingly declare himſelf for the common cauſe againſt the Favourite.</p>

               </note> and the Lords of <hi>Caſtille</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many days thinking of it, found none other that could reliſh
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53255:212"/> with the Duke of <hi>Infantado,</hi> but a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the new King <hi>Charles,</hi> which all of them ſigned, beſeeching him to give them another Regent than <hi>Ximenes.</hi> It was an eaſie matter to foreſee that it would not be granted; and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would wave giving an anſwer to it untill his arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> whither he promiſed to go day after day. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was ſo ſure of it, that he did not give himſelf the trouble of writing about it, neither to the King nor <hi>Chievres.</hi> Nay, his foreſight went a little further; and as he was exceeding watchful to make the beſt of occurrences that were capable to encreaſe his Power, ſo the Conſpiracy of the Nobles offered him two means for that, which he did not let ſlip.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53255:213"/> by oppoſing ſo many men capable of reſiſting the Turkiſh Pirats, that they ſhould not dare to ſet foot on Shore in a Country which they ſhould find ſo well guarded: That their Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties had not thought it fit to Arm the Peaſants, becauſe that would take them off from labouring the Land, nor all the Inhabitants of Towns neither, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Commerce might thereby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; but that they had only cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the honeſt Burghers, who having much to loſe, would take the greater care to keep it: That thoſe who would liſt themſelves in that <hi>Militia,</hi> ſhould be exempted from the harder offices of the State: That they ſhould afterwards have priviledges granted to them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Services which they rendered: That care ſhould be taken to ſet Officers over them to inſtruct them; and that all that was demanded of them at preſent, was to perform exerciſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sunday.</p>
            <p>The Nobility at firſt perceived the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and with all their might oppoſed it. The Towns where they had got greater credit than he, would not ſuffer the Commiſſaries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Muſters, to put the Edict in execution, and the others received
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53255:213"/> them with open Arms; for beſides that they were acceptable to the Burghers for the novelty of the Order which they brought them, they rendred them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the State, and opened to them the fair way, which was that of Arms, of raiſing themſelves above the condition wherein they were born, and of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt important charges in the Monarchy: which in progreſs of time would have ſo debaſed the Nobility, that ſcarcely would there have been any more talk of them.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Caſtille</hi> was divided into two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and as there are Mountains that cut it almoſt into two equal parts, ſo the other ſide of the Hills was almoſt wholly for the Nobility, and this ſide for <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> The Cardinals party was not the leaſt, ſeeing he had the braveſt and moſt expert Soldiers of his Country-men for him; and the only circumſpection he was to uſe, was to hinder his Enemies from poſſeſſing the Court of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> with bad impreſſions of his deſign. In proſpect of that he wrote to <hi>Chievres,</hi> praying him to repreſent to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King in full Council, that there was no other expedient than what he had put in practice, for preſerving his two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies entire for him, and without a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53255:214"/> farthing charge, until his arrival in <hi>Spain:</hi> That it was no new thing in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille</hi> to Arm the People; and that the Kings his Predeceſſors had done it as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it was neceſſary to ſtop or puniſh the inſolency of the Nobility: That King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, his Grandfathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had put it in practice; and that the Hiſtorians of <hi>Spain</hi> impute all the misfortunes that befel him to no other cauſe, but the pernicious counſel that was given him, and which he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in disbanding the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Troops which he had raiſed, and putting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their place, who had ſhamefully betrayed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> approved the project of <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and got it to be approved by <hi>Charles,</hi> but it was for another reaſon than what the Cardinal had mentioned in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The actual poſſeſſion of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the Hereditary Provinces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> which were to fall to his Catholick Majeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his paternal Grandfather, and the Empire which he intended to canvaſs for, were three very important motives that ſuffered him not to make a long ſtay in <hi>Spain,</hi> and would in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance call him from thence as ſoon as he ſhould be acknowledged there for
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53255:214"/> King: Whence <hi>Chievres</hi> concluded, that it would be impoſſible then to conceal it from the Nobility, that they could not long enjoy the preſence of <hi>Charles;</hi> and that in that caſe they would make it their whole care to deliver themſelves from the ſubjection under which they pretended the late Kings <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabelle</hi> had held them, and to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh themſelves in the right; or to ſay better, in the licentiouſneſs which they had taken to themſelves many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of ſecurely revolting when ever the whimſey took them in the head. Their Rebellions, indeed, had been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, yet they never proceeded to the depoſition of Kings; becauſe theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having never gone out of their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, came ſeaſonably enough to the places where the Revolt had begun, to ſuppreſs it at firſt; and as they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſerved to themſelves Friends amongſt the diſcontented Grandees, ſo their defection was never univerſal: Whereas if they had a mind to riſe in the abſence of <hi>Charles,</hi> nothing could croſs their union; and the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> being amongſt them, they would chuſe him for their King, which muſt needs give birth to a War that could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ended, but by the death of one
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53255:215"/> of the two Brothers, whom the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Nobility had ſet together by the Ears. It was therefore, in the opinion of <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> a maſter-piece of State-policy, above all things to prevent that Revolt of the Nobility, by means the leſs ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Catholick King had no hand in it; and the means offered freely without being invented or ſought out by the Council of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> There was no more to be done, but to confirm by Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority the <hi>Militia</hi> of the honeſt Burghers, which in every Town would oppoſe the attempts of the Nobility, and keep the People in duty; and as <hi>Ximenes</hi> denied not to be the inventer of it, ſo would he bear all the hatred, and all the benefit thereof would redound to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty,</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe animated with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which <hi>Chievres</hi> uſed to back the propoſitions that he would have paſs without contradiction, was applauded ſo in the Council of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and the conduct of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> as that the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> of honeſt Burghers in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> was unanimouſly approved. He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved praiſes for it; Letters were directed to the Kings Officers to ſee it put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and thoſe that oppoſed the ſame, were declared guilty of High Treaſon,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53255:215"/> of what quality ſoever they were. <hi>Ayala</hi> was ſent to the Cardinal to carry him the News; and the Nobles ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abandoned of the Court, were ſoon divided. The Conſtable was the firſt of them that made his reconciliation with <hi>Ximenes;</hi> and the reſt, in ſtead of taking it ill that he had forſaken their company, prayed him to make their peace. He ſerved as Mediator for the Grandees of his Faction; and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal having embraced them, thought it neceſſary for hindering them from ruining his work, when any occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to eſtabliſh in every Town of <hi>Spain</hi> four new <hi>Syndicks,</hi> to take care of the ſubſiſtence of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Court of any enterpriſe that might be made for ſuppreſſing it. It is amazing, that the greateſt men as well as others ſhould ſometimes be ſubject to the fault of being more touched with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries than favours, and more apt to take offence than to be grateful. <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> knew very well, that he owed the preſervation of his Dignity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of his Life alſo, to the laſt Letters written in his favours from <hi>Bruxelles;</hi> and that if they had not ſeconded him according to his deſire, he muſt have been over-poured in the buſineſs of the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53255:216"/> 
               <hi>Militia:</hi> But inſtead of taking it by that handle which ſhew'd his own weakneſs, he took it by another that pleaſed him. That was the obligation which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King had to him, for having ſo entirely brought under the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> that his Majeſty might for the time to come abſent himſelf from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Dominions as long as he pleaſed, and take his own time to canvaſs for the Empire. He thought that having done ſo much for his Maſter, that young Prince ought to do any thing for him; and renewed his inſtances for obtaining an unlimited Power, not with an expreſs declaration as he had hither to done, that he would take that ſavour as a pure grace of his Majeſty, but in the ſtrain that he uſed to demand thoſe things which were his due.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> knew the temper of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> to be apt to paſs from a haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is natural to them, to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream contempt of their Sovereign, ſo ſoon as ever they think they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him that he cannot be without them. He told the Catholick King, that if in the preſent juncture he granted <hi>Ximenes</hi> what he deſired, he would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him inſupportable, and confirm him in an abſolute independance on his
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53255:216"/> Majeſty. That he would conſult him no more, but as in courſe; concerning what he was to do: That he would not read the Orders which he might receive from him; or if he did read them, it would only be after he had acted in his own way, and meerly out of curioſity to ſee if they were conform to what he had done: whereas if the power of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal were at preſent left within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to which the late King confined it, &amp; from time to time afterward augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according as circumſtances might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as had been done in the caſe of the <hi>Militia;</hi> the Cardinal would be more pliant, and the Gentlemen would not ſo impatiently bear his adminiſtration. The Catholick King judged the advice to be ſound, and refuſed <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who ſuſpecting that <hi>Chievres</hi> had been againſt him, reciprocally oppoſed <hi>Chievres</hi> in an affair that follows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> were too weak to ſupport the digging in Mines and other painful labour that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put them to. They commonly died within ſix or ſeven weeks after they had been employed in that drudgery, and the ſtrongeſt of them in that caſe did not out-live two months. Moſt frequently they were forced to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and the inhumanity of conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53255:217"/> them in this manner to ſhorten their days for the profit of others, obliged <hi>Chievres</hi> to look out for means of eaſing them. He hit upon a great many; and that which he moſt approved, becauſe it was leaſt chargeable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was to procure them other ſlaves at a cheap rate. The greateſt traffick on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinee</hi> conſiſted in Men, whom they went to buy from all parts of the World. Fathers ſold their Children, and the Husbands their Wives. And theſe Slaves being Blacks, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Negroes:</hi> They were ſtrong: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, how hard ſoever, was no ſtrange thing to them, becauſe they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it from their youth: They were ſubject to few diſeaſes; and though they were expoſed to all the injuries of the Seaſons, yet they lived long, and by conſequence enriched thoſe who bought them for a Crown a head, provided they were not uſed with too much ſeverity: But if they were ſo uſed, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deſtroyed themſelves, by ſtopping their own breath upon no other account but to vex their pitileſs Maſters. <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> cauſed ſix hundred of them to be bought, and ſent into <hi>America,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who lived in that new part of the World were informed of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53255:217"/> they might have in making uſe of thoſe Black Slaves, ſeeing they might have them ſo cheap. But Cardinal <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> found a great deal to be ſaid againſt it; and pretended that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by not making uſe of the Slaves of <hi>Guinee</hi> had the diſpleaſure to ſee their Works many times unfiniſhed, they had, to make amends for that, the ſatisfaction to be aſſured that the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> whom they brought into their Houſes, would never wrong them, by conſpiring and riſing againſt them: Whereas the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> who were as malicious as ſtrong, would no ſooner perceive themſelves to be more numerous in the new World than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that they would lay their heads together to put the Chains upon them, which now they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ayala</hi> was ſent back to the Court of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> to exaggerate that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but <hi>Chievres</hi> was not ſatisfied with it. He thought it was ſomething elſe that ſet <hi>Ximenes</hi> at work, and attributed to him a more refined conſideration. He drew it from the jealouſie of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> for the <hi>Indies,</hi> which went ſo far, as not to ſuffer any other Nation but themſelves to ſet footing there, leſt they might have a mind to divide the Wealth
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53255:218"/> thereof with them. Nevertheleſs if <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> were tranſported thither, there was ground to foreſee that they would encreaſe and multiply much; hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and bad uſage not hindring that people from being extraordinarily fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and it being the intereſt of thoſe who bought them to marry them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thereby to augment the number of their Slaves: It would no longer then depend on the prudence of <hi>Spain</hi> to reſiſt the multitude of <hi>Negroes.</hi> They would no ſooner know their own ſtrength, but that they would think of recovering their liberty; and if their Inſurrection proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one Region of <hi>America,</hi> it would ſoon become univerſal, by the aſſiſtance that thoſe who had freed themſelves would give to the reſt, to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt after their example.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not ſit for tranſporting of Slaves from one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the World to the other, and had not ſhipping enough to ſupply <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> with ſufficient numbers; whence it followed, that in that caſe they ſtood in need of the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the Subjects of the Catholick King; and that ſo thoſe People getting more knowledge in the <hi>Indies</hi> than it was fit they ſhould, would infallibly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53255:218"/> to ſettle there. However the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King notwithſtanding the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> ſent to the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> the <hi>Negrees</hi> which <hi>Chievres</hi> had cauſed to be bought: But ſive years after he had occaſion to repent of it, becauſe the <hi>Negroes</hi> revolted; and had infallibly taken the Iſland, if by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good fortune juſt when their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion broke out, two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains, <hi>Melchior de Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>Francis d' Avila</hi> had not come, and more by cunning than ſtrength put them again into Chains.</p>
            <p>That irregularity of <hi>Chievres</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the cauſe that he afterwards ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded the Cardinal in the execution of a deſign which appeared not to be much juſter, nor leſs intereſted, and of which nothing but humane malice hindred the ſucceſs. The <hi>Indians</hi> complained that they were uſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> like Beaſts, and the complaint was but too true. There was no Juſtice nor Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates for them: They preached the Goſpel to them in a manner that might make them abhor it: No great care was taken to Baptize them; nor were they more kindly uſed after they had received it. <hi>Ximenes</hi> propoſed the ſending of Commiſſioners to them, <hi>Louis de Figue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roa, Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> Monks of the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53255:219"/> Order of <hi>St. Jerome,</hi> and the <hi>Alcaide Manzanedo,</hi> for ſetling amongſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> Subjects of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Policy much like to that of the Peſants in <hi>Spain;</hi> as if the three perſons named had been ſufficient for a work of that importance. <note place="margin">In the relation of the Fathers of St <hi>Jerome.</hi>
               </note> However <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> got it to be approved in the Council of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and the Commiſſioners ſet fail from the Coaſt of <hi>Andaluſia.</hi> They arrived without any hinderance in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> but there they found ſo great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from their Country-men, that they put hardly any thing of the Order which they had received from <hi>Ximenes</hi> in execution; thoſe who ought to have aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by their Authority being the firſt that conſtrained them to Embark again, and return back to the place from whence they came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John d' Albert</hi> had no ſucceſs in the recovery of his Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> though the Treaty of <hi>Noyon</hi> had facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his entry into it; and, indeed it muſt be acknowledged for the juſtification of <hi>Chievres</hi> in the juncture we are to ſpeak of, that it was not his fault that that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed King was not reſtored. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that had been taken for that great deſign were ſo juſt, that nothing hindred
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53255:219"/> them from ſucceeding, but the ill luck or bad conduct of <hi>John d' Albert.</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt had ſuffered him to raiſe in the Provinces lying betwixt the <hi>Loire</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills, an Army almoſt all old Soldiers, and ſo much the better diſciplined, that they were punctually paid out of the moneys borrowed upon the Jewels of the Crown of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>varre.</hi> If it had marched into that Kingdom, the Towns and Forts would have ſtriven who ſhould firſt have opened their Gates; becauſe four years ſubjection to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Caſtille</hi> was ſufficient to make thoſe of <hi>Navarre</hi> come to themſelves again, and find their deplorable miſtake in delivering themſelves up to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and irreconcileable Enemies. They could not endure that their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be reduced into a Province; and as it was the Faction of <hi>Beaumont</hi> which had been the cauſe of it, ſo they alſo were the firſt that endeavoured to repair the fault. The chief Gentlemen of that party wrote ſo ſubmiſſive Letters to <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> that in every line there appeared evident marks of ſorrow for what was paſt, and of more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obedience for the future. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to return into <hi>Navarre;</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that aſſoon as he were over the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53255:220"/> 
               <hi>Pyrenees</hi> he ſhould find it all in Arms, and ready to encreaſe his Forces: They promiſed to make him Maſter at firſt of one half of the Kingdom, and did not think the reſt could hold out above two or three months longer. But it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true that the mutual love of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons ſurpaſſes that of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and there may be found in Hiſtory almoſt as many Wives who have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Husbands for the good of their Country, as have ſacrificed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the welfare of their Husbands.</p>
            <p>The Hereditary Conſtable of <hi>Navarre,</hi> Son and Succeſſor to him who called the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into it, had gone ſo far as to reſolve in time and place convenient to put himſelf at the head of a party formed to drive them out of it. It conſiſted of twenty thouſand men; and which was very ſtrange, there was not one Soldier of all that great number, who diſcovered the conſpiracy to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Had the Conſtable married a <hi>Navarreſe</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Navarre</hi> would not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto a Province to <hi>Caſtille,</hi> but his project was diſcovered by the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> whom his Father had choſen him for a Wife. <hi>Pedro Maurique,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nagera</hi> had a fair Eſtate in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> upon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Navarre.</hi> The leading men of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53255:220"/> the Faction of <hi>Beaumont</hi> could find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge there in caſe they were too much preſſed by the party of <hi>Grammont,</hi> or by <hi>John d' Albert;</hi> and the Conſtables Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no other view but that, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him with <hi>Briande,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Nagera.</hi> But that ſignified nothing to him when he had put <hi>Navarre</hi> under ſubjection to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, and to compleat the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the young Conſtable his Son, it proved his utter ruine. There was a neceſſity ſeeing he was to form a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Country that might repair his Fathers fault, by reſtoring <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> that he muſt write an inſinite number of Letters, and receive as many. It is not known by what accident, but one of them came to his Ladies hands, who without deliberating and conſidering the conſequences of what ſhe was about to do, carried it to <hi>Ferdinand d' Acugua,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who in all haſt ſent it to <hi>Ximenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal perceiving that the Conſpiracy was ready formed, and that it would ſuddenly break out, took two extream reſolutions very hard to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, eſpecially in a man of his character. He ſent into <hi>Navarre</hi> all the Forces he could draw together under the command
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53255:221"/> of <hi>Ferdinand Vilalva,</hi> the beſt Officer in War that he knew; and gave him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at firſt to labour only to diſperſe the Faction of <hi>Beaumont</hi> without making the leading men priſoners, to the end he might not loſe the time which he might more uſefully employ in guarding the paſſage of <hi>Roucevaux.</hi> If he were ſo ſucceſsful as to defend it, and there to cut in pieces the Army of <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> as the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> heretofore had defeated the Rear-guard of <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> he had Orders, upon his return only, to raze all the ſtrong places of <hi>Navarre,</hi> except <hi>Pampelona,</hi> which he ſhould ſecure with a good Cittadel; that if at any other time the <hi>Navarreſe</hi> might have a mind to revolt againſt the Kings of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> they might be diverted from it by the conſideration, that having no Fortreſſes, they would be oppreſt by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> before the <hi>French</hi> could come to their ſuccour. But if he could not, upon what occaſion ſoever, hinder <hi>John d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> from paſſing the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> he ſhould in all haſt march back again, and ſet Fire to all the Towns, Caſtles, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, Villages, and Country-houſes of <hi>Navarre;</hi> to the end that the <hi>French</hi> finding no ſubſiſtance there, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as faſt as they came.</p>
            <pb n="425" facs="tcp:53255:221"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Vilalva</hi> obeyed the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <note place="margin">In the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Vilal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>
               </note> and yet put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the firſt of the Orders which he had received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extraordinary confidence of his adverſaries gave him an eaſier opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of overcoming them than he hoped for. <hi>John d' Albert</hi> being come to the foot of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> on the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> divided his Army into three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and gave the firſt, wherein was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Faction of <hi>Grammont,</hi> and the other <hi>Navarreſe,</hi> who choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be baniſhed than to be diſloyal to him, to be commanded by <hi>Don Pedro Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralta,</hi> Mareſchal of <hi>Navarre.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which was the main Body, was commanded by the Count and Cardinal <hi>de Foix,</hi> the Paternal Uncles of Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> who by the maxims of Military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline at that time, ought to have been there, yet kept in the reſerve. He made a ſtop very unſeaſonably with the Rear to beſiege the Fort of <hi>St. John,</hi> when he ought to have followed cloſe the Van and main Body, to oblige them by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to ſtand the better upon their guard; and the firſt Body knowing that the Faction of <hi>Beaumont</hi> was for them, and by conſequence not expecting to find
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53255:222"/> the paſſages of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> guarded, marched with ſo little circumſpection, that they fell wholly into the Ambuſhes that <hi>Vilalva</hi> had laid for them. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> beſetting them on all hands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to yield upon diſcretion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcarcely fought for it: <hi>Vilalva</hi> ſent the chief of them, with the Mareſchal, priſoners to <hi>Caſtille,</hi> where, by their own hands, or through miſery, they periſhed. He put the reſt to the Sword, becauſe there needed more men than he had to guard them; and falling immediately after upon the main Body, he put it to the rout. The fugitives coming to the reſerve where <hi>John d' Albert</hi> was, put them into ſuch a conſternation, that they immediately raiſed the Siege of the Caſtle of <hi>St. John,</hi> and retreated into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Bearn. John d' Albert</hi> either could not or would not out-live a ſecond misfortune: He died for grief at <hi>Pau,</hi> and the Queen his Wife lived but ſeven months after him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vilalva</hi> returning victorious, obeyed but too punctually the Orders which he had received from <hi>Ximenes,</hi> in demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrong places of <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſeeing it coſt him his life. Only one eſcaped his fury, which was that of <hi>Marſilla.</hi> It belonged to <hi>Anne de Velaſco,</hi> Marchioneſs
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53255:222"/> of <hi>Falſez,</hi> who was there when one of the Commiſſioners for the demolitions demanded entrance. She refuſed him admittance; and gave this reaſon for it, that ſhe would faithfully keep to the young Catholick King <hi>Charles</hi> the Oath which the late Marqueſs her Husband had taken to the late King, of preſerving to him the Caſtle of <hi>Marſilla</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he had received it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Lady had ſo much credit with <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> by means of the Duke of <hi>Nagera</hi> her Brother, to whom the Cardinal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after gave the Vice-Royalty of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that ſhe ſaved her Husbands perſon and Eſtate: Nevertheleſs, ſhe was ſo ſtrongly perſwaded that he would never pardon the offence that ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in diſcovering the Conſpiracy, whereof he was the Head, that ſhe left him preſently after ſhe had revealed it, and went to her Brothers houſe, where ſhe continued till ſhe died, without ever ſuffering any motion to be made to her of returning to her Husband. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſequel that her fear was not ill grounded, ſeeing the Conſtable having one day met <hi>Vilalva</hi> near his Caſtle of <hi>Lerin,</hi> which they had been demoliſhing and ſilling up the Ditches of, invited him to dinner in his Houſe. <hi>Vilalva</hi> at
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53255:223"/> that time ſtood in extream need of ſuch an invitation, and beſides he could not in civility refuſe it. He was but half way on his journey, and had ſtill a long way to go before he could come to the Caſtle of <hi>Eteille,</hi> whither he was going. He therefore accepted the Conſtables offer, and dined in the Caſtle of <hi>Lerin:</hi> But he had quickly cauſe to repent it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he died upon his arrival at the Caſtle of <hi>Eteille,</hi> in the opinion of being poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There was no great care taken in ſifting the matter; and the Conſtable was thought ſufficiently puniſhed by the inability he and his Faction were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to, of any more riſing againſt the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> for want of places of retreat. Thus <hi>Navarre</hi> was preſerved to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, and neither his Majeſty nor <hi>Chievres</hi> had any hand in it; and <hi>Ximenes</hi> thinking nothing impoſſible for him after the ſucceſs of ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, thought he might take his own courſe, and do his worſt to the Queen Dowager <hi>Germana de Foix,</hi> by wholly depriving her of what rendred her conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in <hi>Spain</hi> after the death of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Husband.</p>
            <p>It hath been mentioned before, that that Prince ſent her to hold the Eſtates of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and the certain advice that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53255:223"/> ſhe received of the extremity to which he was reduced, had obliged her to make all haſt back again unto him. She came only a few hours before he expired, and nevertheleſs timely enough to repreſent to him that ſhe was in great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerable, and even of wanting ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for her ſubſiſtence, if he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not againſt it before his death: That he was obliged to do ſo in Conſcience, ſeeing ſhe was upon no other account de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Eſtate which belonged to her Family in <hi>France,</hi> but becauſe ſhe had married him: That the late moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Louis</hi> the Twelfth, her Mothers Brother, who had promiſed himſelf great advantages by marrying her to his Majeſty, had on the contrary found that that Alliance was more than one way fatal to him; and that <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt his Succeſſor looked upon her as another <hi>Helena,</hi> who had brought Fire into her Country: That the laſt of theſe Monarchs had given all the Eſtate which ſhe ought to inherit, to the younger Brothers of the <note n="*" place="margin">

That in fine, to put ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome an object out of her ſight, ſhe earneſtly beſought her dear Husband to leave her in the remoteſt corner of his Kingdoms, which was that of <hi>Naples,</hi> an alimentary Penſion ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in Widowhood for the reſt of her days, according to her quality: That there ſhe would prepare to follow him to Heaven, by praying inceſſantly night and day for him, and by leading a life as much as lay in her power ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the purity of the Goſpel. So pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick a diſcourſe prevailed with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> to leave the Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her Dowry, thirty thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats a year upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and the Article of the Teſtament, as it was changed, came immediately after

            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who had approved no more than they that Penſion for life, ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no ſooner in a condition to revoke the grant made to Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> by a Husband who otherwiſe had never been liberal, but that without any ſcruple he both attempted and performed it. It is true it was not done after his way, that is to ſay, openly, and without fetching a compaſs; ſeeing he thought it enough at firſt to pray <hi>Chievres</hi> to repreſent to the Catholick King that the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> had been a long time <hi>French,</hi> and that the Faction of <hi>Anjou</hi> was not as yet wholly extinct in it: That it was too dangerous to ſuffer a <hi>French</hi> Queen to have any Revenue there, becauſe ſhe might foment diſcontents in it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of his Majeſties Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:53255:225"/> That the thirty thouſand Ducats ought to be allotted her upon another Fund, and that Fund to be pitched upon in the middle of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That in all times the Towns of <hi>Arevalo, Olmedo, Madrigal,</hi> and <hi>St. Mary</hi> of <hi>Nieva,</hi> which came to the ſame Revenue, had ſerved for Dowry to the Dowagers of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That by good fortune they were not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to any Grandee of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that Queen <hi>Germana</hi> could have no cauſe to find fault that they were given her in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for her Penſion out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> thought <hi>Ximenes</hi> was in the right, and was confirmed in his opinion, when he underſtood that Queen <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> weary of Widowhood thought of marrying the unfortunate Prince of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rento,</hi> the only Son of <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom the <hi>Great Captain</hi> had made priſoner, and ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> after he had ſworn upon the Holy Sacrament to leave him in liberty. The occaſion that offered was the moſt favourable that could be deſired, becauſe it was unſeemly for the Catholick King to meddle with the Teſtament of his Grandfather, which was ſo advantageous to him, and for <hi>Chievres</hi> to propoſe it, ſince he had Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated the Treaty of <hi>Noyon,</hi> whereby
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53255:225"/> the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was to return to <hi>France:</hi> Whereas the Cardinal acting immediately of himſelf, and of his own proper motion, would ſolely alſo procure the envy to which his action might be expoſed, and the hatred of Queen <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana. Chievres</hi> gave it that caſt to his Catholick Majeſty, who failed not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to write to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that he might act in that point as he thought beſt, <note place="margin">In the Letters of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth to <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
               </note> provided he acted as of himſelf, and without dipping the Royal Authority in the leaſt in it. <hi>Ximenes</hi> immediately put the Officers of Queen <hi>Germana</hi> into poſſeſſion of the four Towns which we have named, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the Revenue of the Crown the thirty thouſand Ducats aſſigned to that Princeſs upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> But the Queen was beyond imagination vexed at it; and expreſſed her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the leſs reſerve, that ſhe thought no body to be blamed for it, but <hi>Ximenes.</hi> She ſaw her ſelf obliged to ſpend the reſt of her days in <hi>Spain;</hi> and to make her Court to her Husbands Grandchildren, by whom ſhe never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be well looked upon. She made no doubt, but that their deſign was to oblige her to a ſingle life, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53255:226"/> her ſee the impoſſibility of ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Husband of the quality of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: and as Women wounded in ſo nice a point, give way for moſt part to the temptation of having recourſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means of revenge, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect are wanting; ſo Queen <hi>Germans,</hi> not being able of her ſelf to hurt <hi>Ximenes,</hi> eſpouſed the contrary party, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegued with his moſt dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who were the Governour and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand.</hi> She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to back them with all her credit againſt the Cardinal, and offered them the four Towns that were given her, to ſerve them for a refuge in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the Cardinal's Spies pried into the ſecret of that new intelligence, and made him ſenſible that he had committed a ſignal fault in matter of Politicks. He ingenuouſly confeſſed it to the Catholick King and <hi>Chievres,</hi> in the firſt Letters which he thereupon wrote to them, and ſolicited both of them to help him with all diligence to repair it. He granted that his memory had been treacherous to him; and that he had not called to mind the example of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> Father to King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> and great Grandfather to his Catholick Majeſty, who holding the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53255:226"/> four places which were given to the Queen, made uſe of their ſituation, and the Works that he added to them, for maintaining above thirty years a Civil War in <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That the ſame thing was to be feared from Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> and perhaps a worſe in the preſent jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: That ſhe kept intelligence with thoſe whom the late King had entruſted with the Education of the <hi>Infanto;</hi> and that the inconveniences which might ariſe from thence, to the diſturbance of the publick tranquillity, could not too ſoon be prevented.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals Letter was examined in the Council of <hi>Bruxelles;</hi> and <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> found the affair to be difficult, not only in it ſelf, but alſo in reſpect of the perſons that were concerned in it. For if the Teſtament of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were twice on end diſappointed, his Succeſſor would paſs for ungrateful, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for fickle, and not well ſeen in the intereſts of their Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſellors of State, who were already but too jealous of them, would thereby take occaſion to decry them; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their conduct ſo odious, that their reputation would be loſt when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Catholick Majeſty into <hi>Spain:</hi> Whence it would follow, that if
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:53255:227"/> he intended to ſatisfie his new Subjects, he would be obliged no more to conſult the <hi>Flemings,</hi> whom he brought along with him. If the Cardinal were refuſed, they would provoke him at an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, and diſcourage him from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in execution the reſolution which he had taken of oppoſing all that was great in <hi>Spain</hi> below the King, which was altogether advantageous to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty during his abſence: They would be expoſed to the danger which <hi>Ximenes</hi> foreſaw, and kindle a fire in <hi>Caſtille</hi> of long continuance before they could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to quench it.</p>
            <p>The expedient that <hi>Chievres</hi> found out to avoid ſplitting upon either of theſe two rocks, was to write an anſwer to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that the Catholick King thought it not fit to meddle a ſecond time with the affair in queſtion, until he himſelf were arrived in <hi>Spain:</hi> But that nevertheleſs the Cardinal might put into <hi>Arevalo</hi> and <hi>Olmedo,</hi> which were the beſt of the four places, ſo many truſty perſons, that he might be ſure to be Maſter of them, in caſe Queen <hi>Germana</hi> attempted any ſtirs: That the two other places would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to her without them; and that the ſureſt conduct that he could then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in relation to that Princeſs, was to
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53255:227"/> obſerve her narrowly, but without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her cauſe or pretext of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> was not ſatisfied with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, yet nevertheleſs he put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, becauſe it anſwered in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his ends, by putting his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out of condition of doing him preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. He made himſelf inſenſibly the ſtronger in <hi>Arevalo</hi> and <hi>Olmedo;</hi> and the intriegue he uſed for ſlipping into thoſe two places near a thouſand Soldiers diſguiſed, of whom he was ſure, was ſo neatly managed, that Queen <hi>Germana</hi> perceived it not. He viſited from time to time Queen <hi>Jean</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſillas,</hi> where the late King her Father had ſhut her up, and with extream trouble found that the folly of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs encreaſed with Age. The diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was incurable; but for want of a cure, which was not poſſible to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane means, he found ways of eaſing the Patient. He attentively ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died her humour, and obſerved that of all the paſſions to which ſhe had been ſubject, whilſt ſhe had the uſe of reaſon, there remained none, now her Reaſon was gone, but Ambition, whether that had been then her predominant paſſion, or that the Organ that ſerved to retain it
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:53255:228"/> was alone preſerved free from the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought upon all the other Organs of the rational functions. By that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſpoſe her to ſuffer her ſelf to be made clean from the filth ſhe was encompaſſed with, <note place="margin">In the laſt years of the life of <hi>Jean.</hi>
               </note> and that they might diſpel at leaſt for ſome hours of the day, that Hypochondriacal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy which infeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He cauſed ſeveral perſons who had a way of fooling with them, tell her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> were ſorry they had not acknowledged her for their only Sovereign from the time that Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle</hi> her Mother died; and that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragoneſe</hi> were mad with themſelves, that they had fallen into the ſame fault after the death of her Father: That both of them were about ſending Deputies to beg her pardon for it, but that it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her alſo on her part to put her ſelf in a condition to receive them, as it became a great Queen: That her Apartment was ſo naſty, that it would turn their ſtomachs to come into it; and that it would be convenient to begin by times to make it clean, to the end no offence might be given to their Eyes and Noſes:
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:53255:228"/> That they muſt be received by her in great pomp, and by conſequence with good company: That her Majeſty gave acceſs but to too few people about her, and that ſhe muſt admit of a more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Train: That ſhe ought to Eat in publick at leaſt once a day; and that that was the time when the Muſicians deſired by their harmony to diſpoſe her ſtomach to a more quick and eaſie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>He made her afterwards accept of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſant companies of both Sexes, inſtructed to imitate her extravagancies, and above all things to contradict her in nothing directly; and not to croſs her humours indirectly, but by making her believe that they ſuited not with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the greateſt Queen in the World. He ſo tamed her by that means, that ſhe was checked with the leaſt wink of an eye of <hi>Ferdinand Talavera,</hi> whom the Cardinal placed about her, inſtead of <hi>Leo Ferriera,</hi> too old and grave for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Commiſſion of Governing her, which the late King had given him; and at length they accuſtomed her on Sundays and Holy-days to hear Maſs in a Church at ſome diſtance from <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillas,</hi> upon pretext that ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the way, and on the place, the

            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> received for this more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of gratitude, than for any other of his actions, though it was not the moſt important of all. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King thanked him for it in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: <hi>Chievres</hi> complemented him in the ſame manner: <hi>Spain</hi> reſounded his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the Grandees were ſo ſatisfied with it, that they were not heard to murmur any more againſt him.

               <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Admirals of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which reached to the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Sea, or to the Ocean, ſhould have their Judicatures fixed in the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Ports of their Coaſts, and that their Judges ſhould there try all Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Civil Cauſes that happened to Sea-men, Soldiers on board of Ships, Paſſengers, and to the <hi>Militia</hi> appointed
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:53255:229"/> for the guard of the Sea-ports: But in proceſs of time an abuſe had crept in, which grew daily more and more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. The Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the Mediterranean Sea were not now ſo much expoſed to the incurſions of the Infidel Pirats, after that <hi>Ximenes</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Oran,</hi> and the other places on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and by conſequence had no more need of ſo many Veſſels nor Soldiers to guard them. So the number of Juſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons in the Admiralties was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; and the multitude of their Officers not having been proportionably ſuppreſt, their Courts for moſt part had nothing to do. They were therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſeek for practice, if they had a mind to exerciſe their Juriſdictions, and they found ſome, by a means that tended to the eſtabliſhment of Impunity for all ſorts of Crimes in the Towns where it was in uſe. Thoſe who had been guilty of enormous Crimes, and were by Royal Juſtice condemned to Death, found ways to prove, that they had been Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Soldiers, Paſſengers, or Coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, and under that pretext deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be referred to the Courts of the Admiralty. It durſt not be refuſed them, becauſe the Admiral would have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53255:230"/> interpoſed in the affair for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Priviledges, and would have had it examined in the Supream Council of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſo ſoon as the Priſoner was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved unto the Priſons of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was almoſt ſure of his life, ſeeing a little money could always bring him off. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the</hi> Malaguins.</note> The Town of <hi>Malaga,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> had the greateſt Traffick of any, becauſe of its excellent Wines; and as ſtrangers came there in greateſt numbers, ſo the Officers of the Admiralty there abſolved alſo more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. The Burghers had often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it to King <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and had beſought him entirely to aboliſh the Courts of Admiralty, or to diminiſh the number of the Judges: But his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had had no regard to their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whether he feared to diſoblige all the Admirals of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe cauſe in that particular was common with the Admiral of <hi>Granada;</hi> or that he thought the Burghers of <hi>Malaga</hi> would be too free, and by conſequence grow inſolent, if the Court they complained of were aboliſhed. But after his death the Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that Town applied themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the new Catholick King,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53255:230"/> without firſt addreſſing themſelves to <hi>Ximenes.</hi> They demanded of him no more the alternative of the ſuppreſſion of the Offices of the Admiralty, or of their reduction to a ſmaller number, but purely the total ſuppreſſion; and by their Deputies, whom they ſent to the Court of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> maintained, that ſince the reaſons which heretofore obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to enlarge the priviledges of Admirals, ceaſed, theſe priviledges ought to be reduced to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.

The firſt ſeemed to him to be too ſevere and mortifying, and the next too uncivil.

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53255:231"/> cauſe to repent it. That he was not well enough acquainted as yet with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that that Nation haughty towards all kinds of men, became infallibly inſolent towards their Superiors, when they ſeem to be afraid of them, by managing them with too much circumſpection: That he thought he had only written a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the laſt words of his anſwer to the <hi>Malaguins;</hi> but that he would ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The event was more troubleſome that <hi>Ximenes</hi> had predicted; and the <hi>Mals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins</hi> imagined that they had obtained what they deſired, for this only reaſon that on the one hand it had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them; and on the other, that they had been civilly anſwered.

They begged his pardon in a diſcourſe mingled with ſighs at every word, and that he would vouchſafe at leaſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Malaga</hi> from violence, bloud, fire and plunder. The Cardinal who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

He proteſted that ſo long as he were Regent, his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould go along with the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: That the rebound of the one would infallibly glance upon the other: That his own and Maſters Reputation went hand in hand; and that having ſo ſignally re-eſtabliſhed it in regard of the <hi>Malaguins,</hi> he had reaſon to hope, that if at any other time it were to be put into the balance, they would conſider a little better on't firſt in <hi>Flanders.</hi>

Mota</hi> finding himſelf expoſed to his reſentment, and there being no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for him to ſtay in his Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupport, bethought himſelf of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for a protector abroad: He wrote to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian, Philip</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it belonged to him to Govern <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> during the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Daughter-in-Law, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of his Grandchildren: He ſuppſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a great many Articles of <hi>Caſtillian</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> Laws, which deferred the Regency to him in the caſe then in queſtion: He gave him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, that were to be found in the Hiſtory of the Country: And intimated
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53255:234"/> to him, that his reputation would be blaſted, if he ſuffered the Catholick King to ſupplant him. It is not known by what trick the Letter came to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: But certain enough it was; and that <hi>Mota</hi> being afraid of his life, or at leaſt of his liberty, ſought for a refuge out of <hi>Spain,</hi> though he well foreſaw, that if he left his Country, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf of the beſt quality he had for advancing himſelf, which was that of Preaching before thoſe who perfectly underſtood <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> It came firſt into his mind to withdraw to <hi>Rome,</hi> but he rejected that notion, becauſe King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> was too powerful there. Nor could he ſix upon <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> where his Catholick Majeſty was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, becauſe he was afraid not to find means of ſubſiſtence in either of them; but out of meer neceſſity choſe the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> All the caution he took for being the better received there, was to procure from the Grandees of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> Letters of recommendation to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke and <hi>Chievres,</hi> to the end he might receive from the Son a reward for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices rendred to the Father. But his proceedings were ſo nearly obſerved, that King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> knew upon the ſpot, from whom he had received his Letters
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53255:235"/> of recommendation, and the Box he had put them in. His Majeſty was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that he went out of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing he expected more hurt than good from him if he continued there. He valued him not ſo much as to get the ill will of the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> by ſtopping him, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting upon his life, and would not commit a crime upon his perſon. So that he thought it enough to fruſtrate him of his Letters of recommendation; and wrote to <hi>Bernardin de Velaſco,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Burgos,</hi> who had married one of his Natural Daughters, to take ſuch meaſures, as that <hi>Mota</hi> might go out of <hi>Spain,</hi> without Letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet ſtill believe he had them. <note place="margin">

He got the Archduke to ſettle a conſiderable Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him; and after the death of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> procured him a Commiſſion to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Cardinal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his value, made him Biſhop of <hi>Bada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jox,</hi> and endeavoured to make him Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor of his Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo.</hi>

            <p>There are but few people ſo ill-natured as to envy the rewards which they ſee given to the rareſt merit, and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Spain</hi> made the promotion of <hi>Mota</hi> a pretext for letting <hi>Ximenes</hi> alone peaceably to Govern <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſo long as he was fortunate: But from the firſt misfortune that befel him, they took freſh occaſion to endeavour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation. <hi>Horuc</hi> the elder Brother of <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> had ſeiſed <hi>Algier</hi> in <hi>Africa:</hi>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:53255:236"/> From thence he ravaged and moleſted the Coaſts of <hi>Spain;</hi> and threatned to take from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their Conqueſts in <hi>Barbary.</hi> He blocked up their places; and the Cardinal, who was the more zealous to preſerve them, as that it was he that had conquered them, ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the Command of General <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> an Army, which without trouble, raiſed the Blocade of the Infidels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Horuc</hi> not daring to ſtay, ſhut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in <hi>Algiers</hi> upon the approach of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But <hi>Vera</hi> inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied with that ſucceſs, purſued his advantage as far as <hi>Algiers,</hi> and laid Siege to it, without conſidering well enough if he wanted nothing that was neceſſary for a regular Siege in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern way: <hi>Horuc</hi> who was an expert Soldier, at firſt amuſed the Beſiegers: Then weakned them by frequent Sallies: Tired them out by falſe Alarms, which the <hi>Mores</hi> ever now and then gave them both by day and by night; and at length defeated them in a general Sally. With much a do <hi>Vera</hi> ſaved himſelf; and the Cardinal was more blamed for that vain attempt, than he was applauded for the Conqueſt of <hi>Oran,</hi> ſo unjuſt are men in their Judgments. His Enemies at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> ſtood not ſo much in
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53255:236"/> awe as they had done till then: They moved that he might be ſent home to his Church, and turned againſt him the greateſt part of the Counſellors of State, who were offended that he would not ſhare the principal Functions of the Regency with any one of their number, whom they had ſent him for Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal withſtood not that ſhock in the ſame manner as he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto maintained himſelf. He abated a little of his haughtineſs; and juſtified himſelf from the ſlight which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to have put upon his Colleagues, by ſhewing Authentick proofs, that he had acted joyntly with them, ſo long as his Dignity, which was no more eſteemed than as he could make it to be valued, could ſuffer him; and that he had not ſeparated from them, but by their own fault, and when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to it, that he might not break with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> He unfolded this little Court-myſtery, by adding, that they had had the impudence to ſign before him the diſpatches of the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> though one of them was as yet but a Dean, and the other a Lay-man: That if that injury againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Purple, with which he had the honour
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53255:237"/> to be cloathed, had been ſuffered, there had been ground for diveſting him of it; and that all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well in general as particular, not excepting his own Enemies, had ſo much approved that his Colleagues ſhould be chaſtized, by hindring them to exerciſe their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that none took exceptions at, or complained of it.</p>
            <p>As to the Regency the Cardinal wrote to the Catholick King, importuning him to diſcharge him of it, and to ſuffer him to withdraw to his own Dioceſe, there to mind the Spiritual concerns of himſelf and his Flock: That he had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf too many Enemies, to be for the future in a condition of rendring his Country the ſame ſervices, which till then it had received from him: That he foreſaw Civil Wars like to break out again in <hi>Spain,</hi> which for ſo many years had been ſo fatal to it, and yet ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and that it was very decent for a Prelate, ſuch as he was, to be no more but a ſpectator of them.</p>
            <p>The Catholick King, before he had examined the Letter of <hi>Ximenes</hi> in the Council of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> ſhew'd it to <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> who ſuppoſed that ſince the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal himſelf ſolicited his own depoſition, he muſt of neceſſity have certain infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53255:237"/> that a ſtorm was gathering in <hi>Spain,</hi> which he deſpaired of being able to diſſipate: That if he judged himſelf unable to reſiſt it, he was without doubt more convinced of the inſufficiency of him that ſhould be given him for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and that by conſequence, what way ſoever the matter were examined, there could be no hazard in continuing the Cardinal in the Regency; ſeeing if he appeaſed the Tumult he ſpake of, there would be no cauſe to repent of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continued him in Office; and if he quelled it not, this would be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, that it was certain none could have ſucceeded better in it than he. Upon that conſideration then, his Catholick Majeſty made anſwer to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that <hi>Spain</hi> had more need than ever of his adminiſtration: That he prayed him as a Cardinal, and commanded him as a <hi>Spaniard</hi> not to abandon publick affairs: That he promiſed him nothing of reward, becauſe there was none but what was too low for him; and that he thought it enough therefore to tell him, that if he ſtood no more in need of his Catholick Majeſty, his Catholick Majeſty ſtood extreamly in need of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> of all the Miniſters that went before him, or that came after, until
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53255:238"/> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> the ableſt in Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their Maſters; called then to mind the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>That well-grounded Fortunes are not ſafely ſhaken, and that every time men fail to overturn them, they fix them the more.</hi> He reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make his advantage of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that had been made to depoſe him; and the more earneſt the Catholick King ſhew'd himſelf that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Regency, the more ſolicitous he ſeemed to be diſcharged of it. Many Letters went to and fro upon ſo new and nice a ſubject; and the end of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was, that the Cardinal condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to continue as he was, till after he had treated on even terms with his Maſter, and by the mediation of <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> articled with him, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ſhould reſerve to himſelf the diſpoſal of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of the Cardinals</hi> Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes <hi>and</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu.</note> Comanderies, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſices, Military Orders, and of the Revenue of the Crown Lands of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon;</hi> and that the Cardinal ſhould have for his ſhare the entire and unlimited diſpoſal of Magiſtracies, places of Judicature, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of Provinces, extraordinary Revenues, of the Soldiers and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in both Monarchies. <hi>Ximenes</hi> kept
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53255:238"/> the Catholick to his word ſo long as he lived, and yet never abuſed that half of Royal Authority which was given him: But Humane Providence is almoſt ever defective in thoſe things which men think they have examined with greateſt exactneſs. From that extraordinary power which the Cardinal had cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnatched from the Court of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> there happened an inconvenience the more terrible, that it ſeemed God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew him, that he is as jealous of the Sovereignty which he communicates, as of that which he reſerves to himſelf; and that he does no more willingly ſuffer, that men born for a private life ſhould offer to Govern independently, than he endures Creatures to rob him of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the Courtiers of <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles</hi> had intelligence of the death of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> but that immediately they conceived hopes of dividing amongſt them the chief Dignities of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> as ſoon as they became vacant. The Regency of <hi>Ximenes</hi> had not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, becauſe they thought it would ceaſe upon the arrival of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King in <hi>Spain:</hi> But when they underſtood that his Majeſty had tied his owns hands in favour of that Cardinal,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53255:239"/> and had remitted to him the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part of the Government, until he was compleatly of Age, they were as much offended thereat, as if their Maſter had robbed them of what he had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of condition of granting to them. They foreſaw that <hi>Ximenes</hi> would beſtow no favours but upon Native <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and the fear they were in of dying before their Maſter was of Age, made them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to be rich before that happened. They knew that the Revenue of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> would ſuffice to maintain him ſo long as he were in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and in that proſpect they inclined him to grant them by way of gratuity almoſt the whole Revenue of the Royal Demain of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the Revenue of <hi>Arragon</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the hands of the Eſtates of the Country, by the fundamental Laws of that Monarchy, till the new King went tither in perſon, and had ſolemnly ſworn to maintain the priviledges of the <hi>Arragoneſe.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who for want of money had not obtained the Charges and Benefices which they had gone to <hi>Bruxelles</hi> to ſolicite for; and thoſe of the ſame Nation, who had ſtraitned themſelves by purchaſing them for ready money, returned for moſt part both alike diſſatisfied. They conſpired in like manner to revenge themſelves of the repulſe they had ſuſtained, and of the draining of their Purſes, by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that which <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> a King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> ſaid heretofore of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, <hi>That it was to be ſold,</hi> was exactly true of the Monarchies of

            <p>Theſe diſcourſes at firſt whiſpered only in the Ear, and afterwards ſpread in publick Aſſemblies, and even in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, made ſo great impreſſion upon the Cities of <hi>Leon, Burgos</hi> and <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> that they reſolved to ſend Deputies to the Catholick King, for the univerſal and abſolute removing of <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and for the diſtribution of Grants by the advice of the Council of <hi>Madrid.</hi> It was to no purpoſe for Cardinal <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to repreſent to them that they offered too much for the firſt Eſſay, by attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to bind the hands of their Sovereign in ſuch a manner as had never as yet been practiſed in <hi>Spain:</hi> That if he had not the liberty to chuſe thoſe of his Council, nor to do kindneſſes to whom he pleaſed, he would be more unhappy than the meaneſt of his Subjects, who fully enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both theſe priviledges; and that it was not always neceſſary for remedying of publick no more than of natural evils, to cut off even to the root.</p>
            <p>So great was the obſtinacy of the People, that the Cardinal not being able

He wrote to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Eſtates muſt be allowed the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But that it behoved alſo to be in ſuch a manner as that the Catholick King might receive no diſadvantage thereby: That it ſhould be put off until his Majeſties arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> which would not be before Autumn, One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Five Hundred and Seventeen: That his Catholick Majeſty in all appearance would be ready to part about the middle of Summer, and that upon that deſign a Fleet ſhould be ſent to expect him upon the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders:</hi> That the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of the Seaſon would infallibly ſhorten his Voyage, and that on all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards the Harveſt Seaſon was the moſt ſecure, provided it were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be ſo charmed with the preſence of their new King, that they would have no more thoughts of limiting his power, nor any thing elſe; and that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Eſtates would be wholly taken up in reciprocal civilities of the Deputies to his Majeſty, and of his Majeſty to the Deputies.</p>

He went and fell on his knees before <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and begg'd his pardon for the injury that he was conſtrained to do him: Having uſed that caution, he repeated word for word all that he was charged to tell him; and the Cardinal, who no leſs admired the ſimplicity than the blind obedience of the Church-man, heard him as peaceably as if he had been ſpeaking verſes to his praiſe. He did not interrupt him; changed neither countenance nor poſture; and replied only two things with as moderate a tone, as if what he had heard had been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent to him; firſt, That a Prieſt as he was, ought not to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a Commiſſion ſo miſ-becoming his character; and next, that he ſhould make haſt back again to the Duke; and that he would find him ſorry for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent words that he had put into his mouth. It is not known what ground there was for the prophecy, but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it proved true. <note place="margin">In the relation of that quarrel.</note> The Duke whoſe paſſion had hindred him from reflecting upon the command that he had given to his Chaplain, judged it ridiculous ſo ſoon as it was over. He chid thoſe that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:53255:244"/> were then about him, for having ſuffered him to do it, and hardly forbore puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Chaplain at his return, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo readily and faithfully obeyed him. He ſent him back immediately to make an Apology to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the obligation that he had to the Duke, for having refuſed to engage in the intereſts of <hi>Pedro Giron,</hi> conſented that the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe for an accommodation. It was no hard matter for the Conſtable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, ſeeing both parties deſired it with equal earneſtneſs: But juſt as the Articles were finiſhed, a circumſtance intervened that was within an Ace of breaking it up in an irreparable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal and Duke had their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview at <hi>Fon-Carrallio,</hi> where the two parties and Mediator judged it not fit to bring almoſt any body along with them, to the end they might confer together with greater freedom. The Cardinal had even concealed the matter from <hi>Don Juan de Spinoſa,</hi> Captain of his Guards, who coming to know of it by another way, thought that his place obliged him to go and Guard him at leaſt upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſince he would not be attended when he went. He cauſed his Troop to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:53255:244"/> mount on Horſe-back, and arrived with it at <hi>Fon-Carrallio</hi> about the end of the interview. The Duke and Conſtable no ſooner heard the Neighing of the Horſes, and the Trumpet that ſounded before the Troop, but they imagined that <hi>Ximenes</hi> dealt treacherouſly with them, and had ordered Forces to come and ſeize their perſons. They openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it; and <hi>Ximenes</hi> who knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be innocent, fell a laughing at their panick fear. He lookt out at the window; perceived <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> made him a ſign to come to him; ſharply reproved him for his unſeaſonable diligence; threatned to turn him out if he did the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is to be believed, that if <hi>Ximenes</hi> had been of his humour, there would have been no more of the matter: But there was not in all the world two men of a more different temper, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they were intimate friends. <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> thought there could not be a more enormous fault in Politicks, than any way, or for any cauſe whaſoever, to connive at attempts againſt the Sovereign Power, and in ſuch a caſe never made any diſtinction betwixt high and low conditions. The Biſhop on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was poſſeſſed with an opinion, that there was fleſh and bloud in actions againſt Sovereignty, as well as in others; and that though the conſequence of the former required a greater ſeverity to be uſed againſt them than againſt the latter, yet it followed not from thence that pity and mercy ſhould be abſolutely baniſhed from them. So <hi>Ximenes</hi> ordered all thoſe who had reſiſted Juſtice, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and ſent the <hi>Alcaide Sarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento</hi>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:53255:246"/> to proſecute them, with orders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make an end of, nor deſiſt in the Suit, until the Criminals were brought to exemplary puniſhment, and <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fratre,</hi> which had ſerved them for a place of retreat, demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>By that means all the high Nobility were attacked; becauſe there was not a Lord in all <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who was not related, either in bloud or affinity, to theſe four young Lords, or at leaſt who aſpired not to be ſo. And, indeed, the Criminals fearing to be apprehended in the Field, or in the Caſtles of their Fathers, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Villa-fratre,</hi> which they defended ſtoutly enough: But <hi>Sarmiento</hi> laid a formal Siege to them, and in proceſs of time reduced them to great extremities. He bore with all the railleries that they put upon Him and <hi>Ximenes,</hi> whoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they dragg'd about the Streets; and put them ſo hard to it, that they were come to the laſt bit of Bread, when find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by chance a quarter in the Lines worſe guarded than the reſt, they forced through with Sword in hand, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in the mountains of the <hi>Aſturias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> having miſſed the prey which had eſcaped from him, turned his anger againſt <hi>Villa-fratre,</hi> which he cauſed to
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53255:246"/> be demoliſhed to the very foundations. By his orders the place where it ſtood was Ploughed up, and Salt ſown there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Seven of the chief Burghers were whipt, for having affronted the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whilſt they were a beating of him; and a Servant of the Admiral of <hi>Caſtille</hi> was ſerved in the like manner, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried Soldiers to his Maſters Son. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> incenſed at this rigour, wrote both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to their King in <hi>Flanders,</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning him by all means to deliver them from the tyranny of <hi>Ximenes.</hi> They prayed <hi>Chievres</hi> to joyn his credit to their requeſts; and this is a proper place to convict the Hiſtorians of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> of falſhood, who pretend that the Cardinal had not a greater Enemy at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> than <hi>Chievres.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if his averſion had been ſuch as they ſet it forth to have been, <hi>Chievres</hi> found the moſt favourable occaſion that he could have wiſhed for, for ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> ſeeing he needed not ſo much as to be ſeen in the diſgrace of that Cardinal. He had no more to do, but to ſtand aſide, and leave him alone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Cauſe againſt ſo many Enemies combined for his ruine. He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly have loſt it, and the Catholick
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:53255:247"/> King ſeeing himſelf reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of diſcontenting irreconcileably the Nobility of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> or of ſacrificing <hi>Ximenes</hi> unto them, would have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſecond before the firſt: But <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> forſook not the Cardinal at ſuch a pinch, where he abſolutely ſtood in need of aſſiſtance to ſave him from an utter diſgrace. He repreſented to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, that now it was his true intereſt more than ever to ſupport <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> and if he yielded but the leaſt in that point, he would immediately have cauſe of repenting it. That ſo long as the Cardinal was protected, the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was in no danger in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one hand he would keep the Nobles in their duty, by a ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Laws; and on the other hand the People loved him too well, and were too much obliged to him for the Juſtice he rendred them againſt the Nobles, to make any Inſurrection, or to ſecond the diſcontents of the great men: But if it appeared that the Cardinal were no more in ſo great favour at Court, the Nobility would inſtantly riſe in Arms, under pretext of depoſing him, but in reality to raiſe the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> to the Throne; and the People beginning to deſpiſe the Regent, as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53255:247"/> do thoſe who are out of favour what way ſoever their misfortune befal them, would be leſs reſerved in following the example of the Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi>'s diſcourſe had the effect which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Letters of</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth to</hi> Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> and the young King approved the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals conduct ſo ſtedfaſtly, that the Grandees of <hi>Caſtille</hi> having in vain ſolicited the Citizens of <hi>Leon, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> and <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> who remained in obedience, were forced to receive the Law which the Cardinal was pleaſed to impoſe upon them. It appears not neither by the Orders which at that time he received from the Court of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> nor by the Letters that <hi>Chievres</hi> wrote to him, that he was enjoyned to manage the affair that then was upon the ſtage with more moderation than he was wont to do: Nevertheleſs he did it, and the clemency which he uſed was the more admired, that he had never till then practiſed the like, nor did ever any more for the future.</p>
            <p>He at firſt rejected the overtures of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation which his friends made to him in favour of the four Criminals; and ſeemed ſo inflexible to thoſe who ſpake to him of pardoning, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:53255:248"/> of diſpoſing him to it. The Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals were forced by their own Fathers to go and deliver themſelves up to priſon in <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> and to ſubmit to what the Magiſtrate ſhould order concerning their perſons. The Sentence of the Judges was conform to the ſeverity of the Laws; but <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who had the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his hands, grew milder when it was leaſt expected. He not only ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the execution which would have drawn tears from all <hi>Caſtille;</hi> but gave them an abſolute pardon; and did it in ſo noble a manner, that the ſeverity, whereof he had given ſo many inſtances, appeared not to be natural to him; and that if he uſed not indulgence often, it was becauſe he thought it not poſſible to keep the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> from abuſing it under a Regency.</p>
            <p>He had the better on't alſo of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> in a controverſie they had together about the richeſt Priory of the Order of <hi>St. John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that was in all <hi>Spain. Anthony</hi> of <hi>Zuniga</hi> had been provided to it in the uſual forms, but King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had taken it from him by his own abſolute power, and given it to <hi>Diego</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> third Son to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> by reaſon of the ſervices which that Duke had done him in the Conqueſt
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:53255:248"/> of <hi>Navarre. Ximenes</hi> ſo much hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, that he could not ſuffer it even in his Maſter, though otherwiſe he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly obliged to the Duke. He heard favourably the complaint that <hi>Zuniga</hi> made to him, of being contrary to all right, turned out of his Benefice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do him juſtice. The Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who was ſufficiently perſwaded that the Cardinal would be as good as his word, would not ſuffer his Son to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Council of <hi>Madrid,</hi> at the day to which he was cited by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party. He evaded the deciſion of the Proceſs by all the tricks of Law, and in the mean time made friends with the Catholick King, to have the Cauſe evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Council of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> He could not, indeed, obtain it, becauſe his Majeſty, as hath been ſaid, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> not to allow any more evocations from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Flanders.</hi> But notwithſtanding there was ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. for the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> wrote to the Catholick King in his favours; and their Ambaſſadors in their Maſters names ſolicited <hi>Chievres</hi> to uſe his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that <hi>Diego</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> might not be moleſted. The ſame Kings preſſed <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> alſo to ſuſpend the deciſion of the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53255:249"/> Suit till the arrival of King <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> But the Cardinal, who made no doubt but that <hi>Zuniga</hi> as being the weaker would be caſt by the Catholick King, cauſed the Proceſs to be tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſties coming; and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſo ſtrongly to the Judges, that they ought to conſider nothing but right, that the Son of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was caſt by unanimous voice. However it was not ſo eaſie a matter to put the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in execution as to pronounce it, becauſe the Son of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together Forces, and took the Field to preſerve his Priory: But the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> of the Country falling upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had taken his meaſures for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive part, ſo totally defeated him, that he was obliged in his turn to ſubmit to the diſcretion of <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who uſed him with no greater ſeverity than he had treated the four young Lords we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before. That was the laſt action wherein the Cardinal employed all his power to make himſelf to be obeyed; and it ſo awed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he found them afterward as flexible as if he had been their lawful Monarch. But it is with humane proſperities as with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health: The more ſetled they ſeem to be, the nearer they are to an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> having ſpeeded out the Fleet from <hi>Spain,</hi> for convoying the Catholick King from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Galicia,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about two neceſſary affairs; the firſt was to cauſe all the Sea-coaſts where his Maſter might land, to be exactly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he might diſcover if the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that was ſpread abroad of the Plagues being there was true or not, that ſo he might give him notice in that caſe to put in at other places: And the other, to ſend into the Sea-ports that ſhould be found clear from ſuſpicion, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey put a ſhore there. Upon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he came to <hi>Tordelagula,</hi> the place of his Birth, and went to dine in the <hi>Bourg de Bos-Eguillas,</hi> where he had ſent word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he would exhort the Cardinal ſeriouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having ſaid theſe very words, ſpurr'd a way ſo faſt from the Provincial, that he was quickly got out of ſight, and the Monk made ſo much haſt, that he was all in a ſweat: Yet he came not to <hi>Ximenes</hi> till he was juſt riſing from Table, when the Fiſh had wrought its firſt effect, which was to draw from him a great deal of bloud by the Ears, and the parts where the Nails touch the fleſh. <hi>Carillo,</hi> who had taſted the Trout, was alſo ill; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was certainly believed, though the matter was not made out, that <hi>Barracal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> Secretary to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> had conveyed
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:53255:250"/> the Poiſon into the diſh where the Trout was: Nevertheleſs the Cardinal ſtill made uſe of him as before in his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret affairs, until his very laſt breath. The great difficulty was, and ſtill is, to know at whoſe ſolicitation it was that <hi>Barracaldo</hi> poiſoned his Maſter. The <hi>Flemiſh</hi> writers maintain, that it was by the intriegue of the Grandees of <hi>Spain;</hi> and prove it as well by the quarrels which we related before, as by a Letter of the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> intercepted by <hi>Chievres</hi> ſome days before. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable expreſſed himſelf, that he was not ſincerely reconciled to the Cardinal; and that he was no leſs heartily his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though he had pretended to be neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral in the quarrel that his Son had had with him.</p>
            <p>The writers of <hi>Spain</hi> on the contrary publiſh, that the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Courtiers of their King were the Authors of ſuch a villany; and in their turn prove it by a Letter of <hi>Ximenes</hi> to the Catholick King, wherein that Cardinal uſed all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to diſpoſe his Majeſty to make uſe of none but Native <hi>Spaniards</hi> in his Councils and Negotiations. They add, that <hi>Ximenes</hi> the very ſame day that he ate the poiſon at <hi>Bos-Eguillas,</hi> told thoſe that were about him, that that was not
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:53255:251"/> the firſt time that it had been given him; and that two or three months before, opening a Letter that came to him from <hi>Flanders,</hi> in his Cloſet at <hi>Madrid,</hi> a very ſubtil powder which ſeemed to have been duſted upon the Paper to dry the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, had by his Noſe mounted up to his Brain; and that ſince he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually troubled with inſupportable pains in the head, which encreaſed with time rather than diminiſhed, and that he told his Phyſicians over and over again, that he ſhould die by the hands of ſtrangers: But however it be, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will make it appear, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did not ſuſpect <hi>Chievres</hi> to have had any hand in his poiſoning, ſeeing he employed the laſt of his remarkable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſatisfie him in the thing that he moſt ardently deſired, which was to put the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> out of condition of pretending any thing in the ſucceſſion of his maternal Grandfather and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</p>
            <p>For underſtanding this intriegue which is not ſufficiently cleared in the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> we muſt know that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick King having a deſign, as hath been ſaid, to raiſe the <hi>Infanto</hi> to the Thrones of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thirty two Servants about him, pickt
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53255:251"/> out of the quainteſt wits of <hi>Spain,</hi> to bring him up in that proſpect. Theſe Servants had not deceived him in the Commiſſion he gave them; and ſeeing he had diſtributed the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s houſhold according to the capacity of his Servants, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Hiſtory of the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto.</note> the four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal were given to men who diſcharged them to all the intents and purpoſes that were propoſed in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of them. The Governour of that young Prince was <hi>Pedro Nugnez de Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> already inveſted into one of the chief dignities of the Order of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> which is that of <hi>Claviary,</hi> or chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain: His Tutor, <hi>Alvaro Ozorio,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> who had been a Monk of the Order of <hi>St. Dominick:</hi> His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, <hi>Gonſalo de Guſman;</hi> and the Steward of his houſhold, <hi>Sancho de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men never ſerve better, than when they act for their own intereſt in doing what they are bid; and the Servants of the <hi>Infanto</hi> being ſure of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Offices of State, as faſt as they fell, ſo ſoon as their young Maſter ſhould be King, took all occaſions to inſpire into him the thoughts of Sovereignty which were deſired he might have. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:53255:252"/> till the death of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who by an omiſſion, which it coſt trouble enough afterwards to repair, put not into his laſt Will and Teſtament, that the Servants of the <hi>Infanto</hi> ſhould be changed, a thing abſolutely neceſſary, ſeeing he deprived him of the Crowns which he left him by his former Will; and in ſo contrary a diſpoſition, policy required that ſuch perſons ſhould be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about that young Prince, as might make him forget what was paſt, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſupport the ſtrange revolution of fortune that had befallen him. It is not known whether the three Counſellors of State, who ſuggeſted the laſt Teſtament forgot to propoſe that caution; or that not judging it ſo neceſſary, as indeed it was, they thought it enough that they had obtained the chief, which was to exclude the <hi>Infanto</hi> from the Throne, and neglected the acceſſary that conſiſted in putting new Servants about him: But it is certain, that whatever <hi>Ximenes</hi> could do afterward, he could not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy that inconvenience: For though he obliged the <hi>Infanto</hi> to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with him, and employed more time in obſerving the Servants of that young Prince, than in all the other affairs of State beſides; yet he could not prevent
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:53255:252"/> but that <hi>Guſman</hi> his Governour treated ſecretly with the chief Lords of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who promiſed that if he could cunningly get his Pupil away from the Cardinal, and bring him to them, they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately place him upon the Throne, and acknowledge him for their King.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s Tutor, Negotiated alſo with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Maximilian,</hi> to perſwade him to come to <hi>Spain,</hi> and depoſe <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him the two motives which he thought would be moſt prevalent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to that expedition; one, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntereſts, by promiſing to make her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſs.</p>
            <p>The two Treaties were already far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced before the ſpies of <hi>Ximenes</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that of <hi>Guſman</hi> with the <hi>Arrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> and informed him of it, eight or ten days before it was to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>The Negotiation of the Biſhop of <hi>Aſtorga</hi> was diſcovered by another way. <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who bordered upon ſixty years of Age, was but weakly tempted to marry again; and to rouze him up to take Queen <hi>Germana</hi> for a fourth Wife, there was a neceſſity that ſhe ſhould have had for portion ſix hundred thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats in ready money, as <hi>Bonna Sforza</hi> his third Wife had; or that ſhe ſhould have brought along with her the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Bretagne,</hi> as <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> his firſt Wife, and <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Dreus</hi> his ſecond had done. In the mean while Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> who was no leſs liberal in her way than <hi>Maximilian</hi> was in his had ſaved nothing of the gratuities that ſhe had drawn from the Catholick King her Husband; and beſides, though ſhe had ſucceeded to the Eſtate of <hi>Gaſt on de Foix</hi> her Brother, who was killed at the Battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> yet <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, as we ſhall ſee more at length in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Book, would not conſent that ſhe ſhould ſell it and carry the money to the Emperor, for fear that Prince might take a conceit to lay it out to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>France.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53255:253"/> money as he needed to make a journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> with an equipage ſuitable to his dignity, he was forced to lay aſide his deſign of marrying Queen <hi>Germana.</hi> He was not very reſerved naturally; and it being to no purpoſe for him to conceal any longer the intriegue of the Biſhop of <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> he imparted it to <hi>Chievres;</hi> and by ſo doing abſolutely convinced him, that for the intereſt of the Catholick King it was neceſſary to remove from the <hi>Infanto</hi> all the Servants whom the late King had placed about him, and to give him others that ſhould be devoted to the Court of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> He had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſeveral times to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who acknowledged the neceſſity which <hi>Chievres</hi> repreſented to him, but excuſed himſelf from undertaking the execution of it ſo long as he was in health: Whether it was that he feared to attract the hatred that would rebound upon him from ſo rigorous an action; or that he foreſaw that the Catholick King would not have ſo much need of him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Servants of the <hi>Infanto</hi> were ſent home to their houſes, as he had whilſt theſe Servants were a Bugbear to the Council of State of <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> But when he found himſelf conſumed by an internal heat, which the prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53255:254"/> of water and other cooling things he drank did but more and more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he obſerved no more meaſures, but ſent word to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that he was ready to fulfil what was deſired of him. The only condition which he required was, that the Catholick King ſhould write him a Letter according to the draught that he ſent, without altering a ſyllable in it. The draught contained an abſolute and preciſe order to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> to remove from the perſon of the <hi>Infanto</hi> his Governour, Tutor, Chamberlain, and Steward of his Houſhold, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known to theſe four Servants, that if his Catholick Majeſty ſent them home to their houſes, it was not that he was diſpleaſed with them, and that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not the conduct which they had hitherto obſerved in his Brothers ſervice; but only becauſe he had reſpect to their Age, and that he might not be accuſed of inhumanity, if he gave them not time to take their eaſe when the <hi>Infanto,</hi> who was entred into the ſixteenth year of his Age, needed no more their preſence about him: That he ſhould remember their ſervices, and reward them in ſuch a manner as ſhould ſhew that he was not ungrateful.</p>
            <pb n="491" facs="tcp:53255:254"/>
            <p>The draught added, That for the other Servants of the <hi>Infanto,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty left it to the diſpoſition of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to diſmiſs or entertain them as he ſhould judge convenient. <hi>Chievres</hi> failed not to expede the Letter in the preciſe terms demanded, and to ſend it to the Cardinal. But too much caution had like to have ſpoilt all, not only by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Letter uſeleſs, but alſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Chievres</hi> who knew the importance of it, recommended it particularly to the Courier, who was to Poſt it through <hi>France,</hi> that he might carry it with greater expedition into <hi>Spain.</hi> The Courier diſcharged his duty, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered faithfully the Letter to the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter: But withal forgot not to tell him, that <hi>Chievres</hi> had recommended it to his particular care; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count alone the Poſt-maſter imagined, that it was the advice which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King ſent to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that he was actually embarked for <hi>Spain.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal at that time was in the Monaſtery of <hi>Aguera,</hi> where it was a hard matter to ſpeak to him, becauſe he was under a courſe of Phyſick. The Poſt-maſter took that pretext to excuſe himſelf for not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him the Letter, and kept it full five days. He ſent in the mean while
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53255:255"/> to the houſes of all the Grandees in <hi>Spain,</hi> to give them the falſe news that the King was at Sea, becauſe it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lords, to make Preſents to thoſe who told them the news of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good fortune, that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the State. That buffle-head to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his imprudence on the fifth day car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not the Letter directly, according to its addreſs; but delivered it to the Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> thinking that <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who whilſt he was in health, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him none of the principal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Regency, would not take it ill that he were acquainted with them during his ſickneſs, were it only to eaſe himſelf of ſo much pains. The Biſhop inſtead of acknowledging the obligation which he had to <hi>Ximenes</hi> for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat, which he had procured him in the promotion of one and thirty Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals made by <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, thought it not enough to open the Letter, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhow'd it to the <hi>Infanto,</hi> who on that ſad occaſion reflected with trouble upon all the diſpleaſures he had received ſince the death of his Grandfather, and was convinced that he was about to be totally deprived of the infallible hopes, and even of the certain Inheritance which he had by Birth. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

            <p>The <hi>Infanto</hi> by this diſcourſe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greateſt indignation imaginable, and went inſtantly to make his grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces known to <hi>Ximenes.</hi> He reſolved to have two at leaſt to accompany him, who might ſerve for witneſſes of what paſt in the conference; and ſeeing his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was ſick, he took his Tutor, and ſent to pray the Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> to bear him company. The Cardinal declined it; and to ſay the truth, he wanted confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appear before <hi>Ximenes,</hi> having ſo offended him, though it was only by a miſtake. He had opened the Packet, and ſhew'd it to the <hi>Infanto,</hi> without foreſeeing the advantages which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of that young Prince might draw from that previous light, in engaging their Maſter in their intereſts; and ſo ſoon as he was ſenſible of his fault, he had ſent the Packet to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> with moſt humble excuſes for having opened it.

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:53255:256"/> complaint, with Tears in his Eyes, of the wrong he did him, by depriving him at an unſeaſonable time, and without cauſe of his good and faithful Servants. He added, that he would not have thought ſuch a procedure ſo ſtrange, if it had come from <hi>Chievres,</hi> or the other Miniſters of <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> ſeeing he was born in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it was but too well known in the World, what Antipathy there was betwixt the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> but that it was inſupportable to him to find himſelf ill uſed by <hi>Ximenes,</hi> whom he had till then lookt upon as his beſt friend. He prayed him to leave thoſe about him who were men without reproach, and with whom he was fully ſatisfied, and adjured him to do ſo by the memory of Queen <hi>Iſabelle</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, to whom he had ſo often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that he was ſolely indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> carried it high proportionably as the <hi>Infanto</hi> humbled himſelf: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that he was perſwaded that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair muſt be managed with the height of Authority, and that he would ſpoil all, if he abated in the leaſt; he was alſo of the opinion, and the event ſhewed, that he was not miſtaken, that if in ſo nice a juncture the <hi>Infanto</hi> was treated with
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53255:257"/> as much ſeverity as the other Subjects of the King his Brother, he would think on't ſo long as he lived, and that he would begin betimes to obey him as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly as if he were infinitely above him in birth. And, indeed, <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſpent no time in telling the <hi>Infanto</hi> the reaſons why his Catholick Majeſty would have him part from his Servants.

            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> not ſo much ſtartled at this menace as he made ſhew of being, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly made uſe of it to break up the conference.

               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:53255:259"/> the <hi>Infanto,</hi> who were now turned out, to come to him to the Monaſtery of <hi>Aguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria.</hi> He there received them with looks that ſhew'd neither grief nor joy for their misfortune; and ſhew'd them what concerned them in the Kings Letters, which they had ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before. He liſtened to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints they made thereupon, and fell into a conference with them, wherein he made it his buſineſs to juſtifie the conduct of the Court, which was indeed his own. He ſuffered them to reply; but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to have cauſed them all three to be arreſted, if they had not before they took their leave of him ſeemed wholly ſubmitted to his pleaſure. The Officers of his Guards, who were preſent, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for the ſignal to ſeize their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and it is not known whether the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s Servants ſuſpected it or not: But it is certain there was no neceſſity of coming to that extremity, ſeeing they ended the conference with a proteſtation to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that they were ready to do all that he commanded them; and that they only prayed him to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their honour and intereſts, when he ſhould write to the Catholick King.</p>
            <p>At this rate they were ſuffered to go free out of the Monaſtery, and they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:53255:260"/> performed the promiſe which they had made. All the other Servants were next ſent a going, one only excepted, who by good luck was neither expoſed to the averſion nor jealouſie of <hi>Ximenes.</hi> And that was the famous <hi>Alphonſo Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lego,</hi> who was in his time, what <hi>Lopes de Vega</hi> was in the time of our Fathers. As he was more happy than all other <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in the Poetry of his Country, ſo he gave himſelf wholly to it, and ſpent therein all the hours wherein he was not obliged to attend the <hi>Infanto.</hi> For that end he lived in his Maſters houſe much after the manner of a Hermite; and medled in nothing but verſifying, when he was in the vein, and in poliſhing them when his rapture was over. He was ſo far from intrieguing in other mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that he wholly neglected his own; and <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who knew him to be a man of that temper, had no miſtruſt that he could inſpire into the <hi>Infanto</hi> any other ſentiments but for the Muſes. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in his place of Gentleman ordinary, and augmented his Salary, that he might make it appear, that at the ſame time when he chaſtized the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thirty two Servants of the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heir of the Monarchy, he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the moderation of the three and
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:53255:260"/> thirtieth. He caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Tellez,</hi> one of the wiſeſt <hi>Signiors</hi> of all <hi>Spain,</hi> for ſucceeding to <hi>Guſman</hi> in the place of Governour to the <hi>Infanto,</hi> upon the only account that <hi>Chievres</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to him. But becauſe <hi>Tellez</hi> was then at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> whither the Catholick King had called him, <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> in expectation of his return, put in his place the Marqueſs of <hi>Aguilat,</hi> who afterward got ſo much into his young Maſters favour, that he continued to be chief Governour: The <hi>Infanto</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after having begg'd of the King his Brother to continue him in the place he had about him, which was granted. All the other new Officers of the <hi>Infanto</hi> were choſen by the Cardinal, who in an action of that importance truſted no man but himſelf. None were preferred but for merit; but in the preference of merit, <hi>Ximenes</hi> followed two meaſures, firſt, that they ſhould be of mean extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and then that they ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to no man but himſelf for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He thought that theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be ſufficient to take them off from cabelling, wherein their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had imprudently engaged; and if they were not ſufficient, yet on all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards it would be the eaſier to turn them
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:53255:261"/> off alſo, that they had no relations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed very indifferent as to the alteration of all the Servants of the <hi>Infanto,</hi> ſave only in the removal of the young Viſcount of <hi>Altamira.</hi> He was of the ſame Age with his Maſter, and was placed about him as a Page of Honour. They at firſt contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to play together at the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s vacant hours: But afterward the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of their humours had linked them into a ſtricter friendſhip, than their young years and the diſproportion of their quality ſeemed to allow of. The truth is, the Viſcount had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary complaiſant diſpoſitions to engage his Maſter. He was a perfect Courtier before he knew what was fit to be done to become ſo, &amp; without any other guide but nature and his duty: It was not enough for him to ſecond the inclinations of the <hi>Infanto</hi> with all imaginable exactneſs; but he prevented them by his foreſight, and he was obſerved never to have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any thing to him but what was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The <hi>Infanto,</hi> who on his part loved him moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Elegics of the</hi> Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</note> uſed all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to retain him. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, wept, importuned, and for the
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:53255:261"/> ſpace of twenty four hours refrained eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking: But <hi>Ximenes</hi> was as inexorable upon the account of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as he had been in reſpect of the reſt. The Viſcount had an original ſin which barred him from all favour. He was the Nephew of the Biſhop of <hi>Ozorio</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto</hi>'s Tutor; and if he had lived with that Prince, he might have inſpired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſuch ſentiments as his Uncle plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The fear of this was not without ground, and <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſent the Viſcount home to his Father with Orders to tarry there, until the arrival of the Catholick King in <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus the boldeſt action that was ever ſeen in <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſince the <hi>Mores</hi> made no more war againſt it, was put in execution by a man who hardly ſhew'd any more ſigns of life, but in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the ſharp pains which he felt; and that with ſuch abſolute Authority, that he would employ none in it but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone. Poſterity perhaps will find it now difficult ſtill to believe what we are about to relate: But it is ſo true, that there is no circumſtance nor evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth wanting to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> had wiſely apprehended that <hi>Ximenes</hi> was not powerful enough to change the <hi>Infanto</hi>'s houſhold at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the reaſon of his fear was,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:53255:262"/> that the Governour and Tutor of that young Prince had for kinſmen and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lords of great credit and reſolution, who would not ſuffer without raiſing ſome Tumult, that men from whom they expected much, in caſe of a revolution in affairs, ſhould be turned out of place. Theſe two Lords were the Marqueſs of <hi>Aſtorga</hi> and the Count of <hi>Lemos,</hi> both which, allied to many Noble Families of the Country, perſonally valiant, and expert in War: If they were to be kept in their duty, it could only be by Letters, which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ſhould write to them with his own hand, to inform them, that fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The two Letters were ſent open to <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi> and it was referred to his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cauſe them to be delivered, or to ſuppreſs them as he ſhould judge conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.

            <p>As to the Monarchy which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ought firſt to honour with his preſence, <hi>Ximenes</hi> wrote to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that it was not a thing to be deliberated about; and that ſeeing it was the good fortune of the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> that he landed firſt in their Country, they might have occaſion to take it ill, if he denied them that preference which the ſtorm that forced him thither had given them: That the ſame conſideration would hinder the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> from repining at it; and that however it was, his Catholick Majeſty would never Reign abſolutely in <hi>Spain,</hi>

            <p>It was not the Preſidents intereſt alone, who ſpake to this purpoſe, to make all haſt to Court, the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of State were no leſs earneſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there.

The Preſident notwithſtanding ſet out on his journey, until <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſtopt him, by ſending him the Kings Letters, which ſerved for a regulation of the action he was about. His Majeſty in expreſs terms declared, that he would not ſee the Council, until <hi>Ximenes</hi> were in a condition to come at their head. The Preſident nevertheleſs obeyed not as yet, becauſe he had his excuſe ready, that <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> was ſo bad, that he could not be brought before his Majeſty; and that in the mean while the Council of <hi>Caſtille</hi> thought it inconſiſtent with their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſuffer, that many Lords of the Country ſhould anticipate them, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring their duty to the King. But <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> being informed, that the Council went on in their journey, diſpatched a Courier to <hi>Chievres,</hi> and complained to him of the ſlight put upon his perſon. He ſent him word that the affront would reflect upon the King: He aſſured him, that the arrival of his Catholick Majeſty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n <hi>Spain,</hi> was the ſole cauſe of the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs of the Council in general, and of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:53255:267"/> the Preſident in particular; proteſting, that if before, they had had the boldneſs to diſobey him, he would have inſtantly depoſed them all, as he had changed the Servants of the <hi>Infanto;</hi> and deſired that he might have leave to conclude his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency with the ſame aſcendant as he had begun, and till then continued it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> found nothing in the Letter of <hi>Ximenes</hi> but what was juſt, and was of opinion, that the King ſhould in that particular give him all the ſatisfaction he deſired. His Catholick Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent commands to the Preſident and Council, to return back the way they came: To meet as formerly in the City of <hi>Aranda,</hi> near the Convent of <hi>Aguille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> where <hi>Ximenes</hi> lay ſick; not to budge from thence without new orders; and above all, not to appear before him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Ximenes</hi> were at their head. This was an extream mortification to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Council; but <hi>Ximenes</hi> in ſtead of augmenting it, by inſulting over them at their return, as they apprehended diminiſhed it as much as poſſibly he could. The Admiral of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and other Grandees being vexed at the affront which the Preſident and Council would have put upon him, offered to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him when he ſhould go to wait upon
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:53255:267"/> the King: But <hi>Ximenes</hi> was too wiſe to run the risk of giving his Maſter jealouſie, by accepting of an unſeaſonable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of perſons of ſuch quality. He thanked them for their civility; and told them, that as he had found fault, that the Council went without him to kiſs the Kings hand, ſo his Majeſties Council of State might have reaſon to take exceptions, if he went without them. He therefore prepared to part with the Council upon the firſt orders; and ſeeing he perceived his end drawing near, he could never have thought that his life ſhould out-laſt his favour. In the mean time he found it but too true; and ſince it is in this place that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> writers fall fouleſt upon <hi>Chievres,</hi> it is fit we ſhould know what hand he had in the diſgrace of <hi>Ximenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain that this Cardinal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that he had a ſingular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Country-men, or that he thought they could not ſuffer ſtrangers to have any authority in <hi>Spain,</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oftner than once to the Catholick King, that he ſhould bring with him no <hi>Flemings</hi> at all, or that he ſhould bring ſo few as might give no umbrage. His Majeſty, who kept nothing from <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> had ſhew'd him the Letters of <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:53255:268"/> and <hi>Chievres</hi> at firſt was not ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized thereat, becauſe he did not think they concerned him; whether he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his thoughts upon the alternative, contained in them, in theſe words, <hi>That his Majeſty ſhould bring no</hi> Flemings <hi>at all, or that he ſhould bring but a few,</hi> and that he judged that that alternative ought to be underſtood of him, and the rather, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no reaſon to think it ſtrange, that their King was accompanied by him who had been his Governour, granting he were no <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;</hi> or that he wholly confided in the friendſhip that <hi>Ximenes</hi> had expreſſed to him, and in the good offices which he had rendred him. But he changed his opinion, when he came to underſtand that <hi>Ximenes</hi> was out of all patience, that his Majeſty before he parted from <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles,</hi> had there choſen the Council, which he was to make uſe of in <hi>Spain,</hi> and named all the Miniſters whom he was to employ in it. Not but that a great many <hi>Spaniards</hi> were choſen among the reſt: But beſides, that there were more <hi>Flemings</hi> than <hi>Spaniards;</hi> he had alſo admitted into his Council <hi>Germans,</hi> who were altogether as unacceptable to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as the <hi>Flemings</hi> were.</p>
            <pb n="519" facs="tcp:53255:268"/>
            <p>The Catholick King had done the ſame as to the principal Offices of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> that were not Hereditary; which was the more unſupportable to <hi>Ximenes,</hi> that during his whole life he had been extraordinarily jealous of the grandeur of his Nation. He thought it ſo great an evil, that in his opinion there was no other remedy for it, but to bar all ſtrangers in general from place in Council, and from the Offices of the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and to leave them none, but ſuch as concerned the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, as he was Archduke of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> There was no appearance that <hi>Chievres</hi> was excepted out of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, ſeeing he was the firſt that was provided for, and that he actually enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the two faireſt places of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which was that of high Steward, and of <hi>Comtador Major,</hi> which anſwers to that of Lord high Treaſurer; and that by conſequence, if the reformation began at him, the other Officers would have no cauſe to think it ſtrange, that it came next to them: Whereas if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard were had to his merit and ſervices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <pb n="520" facs="tcp:53255:269"/>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ximenes</hi> finding no mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe two extreams, fell a ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Catholick King to ſend home to <hi>Flanders</hi> all the ſtrangers without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had accompanied him to <hi>Spain.</hi> He was the moſt forward man in the World, to put in execution what he undertook; and ſo ſoon as he had once opened his mind to his Maſter, he wrote to him ſo often about it, that he became troubleſome. <hi>Chievres,</hi> whom <hi>Ximenes</hi> would have ruined, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:53255:269"/> been conſtrained to change his Council and Houſhold upon his ſucceeding to new Dominions; and that if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſubjected himſelf to ſo hard a Law, he would be in a worſe condition than pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, who take thoſe whom they love for their Servants, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or reſerve conſult thoſe whom they eſteem: That he muſt betimes make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſenſible, that they ought to ſubmit to the pleaſure of their King, and not their King to receive the Law from them; and that the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt way of accompliſhing that, was to begin with <hi>Ximenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Catholick King had a particular kindneſs for his Country-men; and though he uſed all imaginable circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to conceal it, yet thoſe who ſaw him often, believed it to be no leſs than that which <hi>Ximenes</hi> had for the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> He was not as yet poſſeſſed with the Maxim of Queen <hi>Iſabelle</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, That Kings ought not to be touched with the ſentiments which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſpires. No body had put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chuſing of his Council after the death of his Grandfather. He had done it of himſelf; and the ſequel made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that it was done with greater prudence than his Age ſeemed to allow.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:53255:270"/> In the mean time he would have been reckoned imprudent, if he had turned off and ſent home into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> ſo many deſerving men, from whom he expected no leſs ſervices than his mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Anceſtors had received from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> It would have ſo reflected upon his reputation in his entring into the World, that it would have been hard for him to have retrieved it again; and nevertheleſs it was abſolutely neceſſary for him to have it unblemiſhed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which he had already conceived of taking juſt meaſures for ſucceeding to his paternal Grandfather in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>So that the anſwers he made to <hi>Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> were not poſitive; and that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal being perſwaded, that his Eloquence would carry what his Letters could not obtain, preſſed the King to ſuffer him to come to him with all expedition; and to allow him long and ſecret Audiences, wherein he might inform his Catholick Majeſty of many things, which he could not exactly learn but from his mouth. But his Majeſty made anſwer, That his health was too precious to the State not to be minded, and that he thought it not fit to expoſe him to a long journey, which would too much incommode him. That
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53255:270"/> the Court ſhould ſuddenly draw near to the Monaſtery where he was; and that then his Catholick Majeſty would not fail to ſee and confer with him as long as he ſhould think it convenient, and to make uſe of his Councils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> perceived very well then that his deſire was eluded, but he was better perſwaded of it, when he was informed that his Catholick Majeſty reſolved to call the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtille</hi> without asking his advice about it. He concluded that he would not have been neglected in an affair of that importance, unleſs he had been diſgraced; and nevertheleſs, the fault that they were about to commit, ſeemed to him to be ſo conſiderable, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e thought he ought to make an effort for preventing it. He wrote not to <hi>Chievres,</hi> from whoſe hand he ſuppoſed the blow to come, but immediately to the King, to repreſent to him, that it was now more neceſſary in <hi>Spain</hi> than elſewhere, that the firſt interview betwixt a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and his ſubjects, ſhould be on the one hand with much affection, and on the other with great ſubmiſſion; and that it had been ever obſerved in all the Country, and eſpecially in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> that the Reigns had always continued as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Caſtillians</hi> were not ſo calm as to be ſafely aſſembled; and that it was the more dangerous to grant them the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eſtates, that they were more preſſing in demanding it: That they pretended to have the ſame liberty again, which they had before the Reign of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> and that they had drawn up the Articles of it: That they would preſs his Catholick Majeſty to ſign them immediately after the opening of the Eſtates; and that if he ſigned them, all the labour of his Grandfather, Grandmother, and of the Regency, would be utterly loſt; if he refuſed to ſign them, he would engage himſelf in a civil War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> added, that the ſole expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be taken, was to Reign abſolutely at firſt: Not to grant the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Convocation of the Eſtates; and ſo to accuſtom them to the yoke during the firſt years of his Catholick Majeſtie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His Majeſty then perſiſted in the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of calling them; and it being out of the power of <hi>Ximenes</hi> to delay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it, he laboured to obtain that at leaſt a place that might be convenient for him might be choſen: He did not himſelf propoſe his Metropolitan City of <hi>Toledo;</hi> but he brought it about, that the Inhabitants of that City went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Catholick King, that they had been almoſt in continual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of having the Eſtates, and deſired that that favour might be continued to them. But it was not thought fit to call them in a place where <hi>Ximenes</hi> was too powerful; and it was feared that the Grandees, who were not fully reconciled to him, would take it ill. So that the City of <hi>Vailladolid</hi> was choſen; and <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
               <pb n="526" facs="tcp:53255:272"/> no ſooner knew of it, but he ſent to hire for him the houſe of Doctor <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> commodious for a ſick perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was out of the hearing of noiſe, and yet near enough the Hall where the Aſſembly was to ſit: But <hi>Terremonde,</hi> a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Gentleman, provided to the charge of high Marſhal of the Court, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it notwithſtanding for another; and that the Cardinal might have leſs pretext of complaining of it, that houſe was appointed for Queen <hi>Germana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ximenes</hi> being perſwaded, that ſince he had taken the Lodgings, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in honour to keep them, wrote to the King, and complained of the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Terremonde,</hi> ſending withal a Gentleman to Queen <hi>Germana,</hi> to pray her to have ſome reſpect to his indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

That he had oftner than once been preſent at the Eſtates in thoſe two times; and that his Servants were always left about him, though the Court of the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> was then more numerous than that of their Grandſon, and that they had more Horſe and Foot Guards than he had: That that was not a reward ſuitable to the importance of his Services; and that calumnies muſt have been more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved than they ought, ſince he was uſed ſo ill.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more dangerous to diſgraced Favourites, than to complain, becauſe they who have ſupplanted them commonly envenom ſuch kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:53255:275"/> that that reply put the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> into, made him entertain two thoughts equally falſe: The one was, that <hi>Chievres</hi> deſiring to procure his Nephew the ſame Aſcendant over the Clergy of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he himſelf had at Court; and not daring to do it directly, becauſe his ambition would thereby have been too viſible, had for that end employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marqueſs of <hi>Villena,</hi> and the other Grandees who were with the King: And the other, that the entry into the Caſtle of <hi>Tordeſillas</hi> had only been denied him by the intriegue of <hi>Chievres,</hi> who needed all the time that the King ſpent there, to diſpoſe his Majeſty to name his Nephew to the Archbiſhoprick, and who foreſaw that the preſence of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> would have been enough to have broken all his meaſures, if he had appeared at Court before the expedition of the Brief.</p>
            <p>What favours a deſigned revenge eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gets place in ones mind; and the King's Uncle was ſo much comforted in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that he found the perſon he was to aim at, that he gave himſelf no more trouble in examining whether his conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was well grounded or not. He took his leave of the Catholick King ſo ſoon as he had been refuſed; and the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:53255:276"/> ſame day left <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> upon pretext that he could ſtay no longer with honour, ſince he had neither place nor rank in the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> He went back Poſt into <hi>Arragon,</hi> where his complaints againſt the Government were heard in all parts, at the ſame time that the report was ſpread at <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of <hi>Chievres</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The Deputies of the Towns, and Commonalty of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who were come thither for the opening of the Eſtates, were the more ſurpriſed at it, that it was without example, that the beſt Benefice of the Country ſhould be conferred upon a ſtranger. At firſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they thought it enough to exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their amazement to thoſe who had a mind to hear them: But afterward, as there is no Nation in the World that trouble their heads more with what is to come than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo through much reaſoning about the future they apprehended, that the <hi>Flemings</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the ſucceſs of their firſt eſſay, would take a liking to the other Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Spain,</hi> and beg them as faſt as they fell. How to hinder them was a very great difficulty, becauſe on the one hand there was no ſtanding Law againſt it and on the other, there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:53255:276"/> that they could impoſe upon the new King a reſtraint from which his Predeceſſors had been exempted.</p>
            <p>For underſtanding this myſtery of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which employed the prudence of <hi>Chievres</hi> for ſix whole weeks, it is to be ſuppoſed that the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at firſt one of the leaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> had not thought fit to take meaſures to hinder ſtrangers from enjoying the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices thereof, ſeeing ſtrangers went only thither to ſerve in the Armies as being <hi>Croſſed,</hi> and to return home again to the ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> from whence they came, when the time was expired wherein they had made a vow to Fight; &amp; if they ſtayed in the Country, they were no more looked upon as ſtrangers, but as <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> becauſe they lived and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly died there, and their Children without contradiction enjoyed all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Native <hi>Caſtillians.</hi> Matters had continued in that ſtate when <hi>Caſtille</hi> was enlarged, becauſe their conqueſts were made upon the <hi>Mores,</hi> who, if they would change their Religion, became <hi>Caſtillians;</hi> and if they perſiſted in the belief of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> were forced to go and live elſewhere.

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:53255:277"/> theſe ſhould enjoy the Benefices of the conquered places, becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Anceſtors had founded them. In fine, the diſpoſition of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices had not been changed there when <hi>Iſabelle</hi> married <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> becauſe that Queen had reſerved it wholly to her ſelf by her contract of Marriage, and named none but Native <hi>Caſtillians</hi> to fill them. But after that <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to <hi>Caſtille,</hi> he two ways contravened the cuſtom eſtabliſhed in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> concerning Offices and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. He provided <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracies and Church-revenues lying in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> with the ſame liberty as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally gave to the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Secular dignities of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and he nominated ſometimes <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> to Offices and Benefices of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> The <hi>Caſtillians</hi> received two prejudices by that Innovation; one in that their Offices and Benefices being more numerous and of greater Revenue than the Offices and Benefices of <hi>Arragon</hi> for two <hi>Caſtillians</hi> that profited of the Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Revenues lying in <hi>Arragon,</hi> twenty <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> profite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:53255:277"/> concerned neither of the two Nations, in regard of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> ſeeing it was certain, that the Catholick King durſt nominate no <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the Offices and Benefices of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> and if he had attempted to do it, the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Provinces would ſooner have revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ſuffered it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> who were nothing ſhort of the <hi>Flemings</hi> in haughtineſs, and far ſurpaſſed them in cunning, reſolved to maintain themſelves as well as they in their ancient cuſtom; and there could not be a more ingenious device than they invented for accompliſhing it. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to confound their ancient cuſtoms with their priviledges; and amongſt theſe they inſerted, that no ſtranger, for what cauſe, and under what pretext it might be, ſhould hold any Magiſtracy or Benefice in <hi>Caſtille.</hi> Nay, their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt went a little farther; and ſeeing they knew that the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> aſpired only to their Offices and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they might convert the vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues that belonged to them into ready money, and tranſmit it into their own Country: They revived one of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws, which upon pain of death, prohibited the Exportation of Gold or Silver out of their Country, without the
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:53255:278"/> conſent of the States. They inſerted both theſe into the Articles which the Catholick King was to ſwear, before he was owned for Monarch of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and preſented them to him altogether. He examined them with <hi>Chievres,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made his Maſter obſerve the cunning of the <hi>Caſtillians.</hi> He repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, that they intended to oblige him to conditions unknown to his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and that if he condeſcended to them, the conſequences thereof would be very bad for the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in general, and in particular for him who ought to be the head of it. That that houſe, indeed, was in a fair way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the moſt powerful Monarchy that ever was in Chriſtendom, ſince the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> but that that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy would have a defect, to which that of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was not ſubject, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Territories of the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> would be too remote one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to afford mutual aſſiſtance in time of urgent neceſſity: That there was no other remedy for that, but to do in the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> with ſome proportion what God hath done in the making of the Body of man, wherein the parts are engaged by their own intereſt for the preſervation one of another: That if
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:53255:278"/> the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of the Magiſtracies and Benefices of <hi>Caſtille;</hi> they would not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble of aſſiſting the <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mores;</hi> as, if the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> enjoyed not the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in <hi>Arragon,</hi> they would not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take Arms again for reſtoring the poſterity of <hi>John d' Albert</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Navarre:</hi> That it was not the ſame in reſpect of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> who could not, indeed, neither aſſiſt nor be aſſiſted by <hi>Spain</hi> by Land, <hi>France</hi> lying betwixt them: But paſſage was open by Sea; and as the Maritine Forces of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> infinitely ſurpaſt thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo <hi>Spain</hi> had incomparably more need of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> than the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> had of it: That the cuſtom of giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Benefices to the <hi>Flemings</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille</hi> muſt not be broken off then, though the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> might not reciprocally have the like priviledges in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by conſequence his Catholick Majeſty ought not to engage himſelf in any thing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Council approved the Arguments of <hi>Chievres,</hi> who was afterwards Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated to adjuſt with the Deputies of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the manner how the King
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:53255:279"/> before he was acknowledged ſhould take his Oath to maintain the priviledges of the Country. The firſt conference was not over before Doctor <hi>Zumel,</hi> who in quality of Deputy of the City of <note n="*" place="margin">Burgos <hi>was as yet the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal City of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille.</note> 
               <hi>Burgos,</hi> was the chief of the reſt, and by conſequence had right to ſpeak before them, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Chievres</hi> was ſo well informed of the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> that it would be impoſſible to impoſe upon him: For <hi>Chievres</hi> made appear by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe no leſs eloquent than ſolid, that the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> had never engaged themſelves, neither not to beſtow the Offices and Benefices of the Country up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrangers, nor yet to hinder the Tranſportation of Gold and Silver out of the Kingdom. He added, that there had been no ground, neither on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillians</hi> part to impoſe that obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Kings, nor on the part of their Kings to charge themſelves with it; and proved it invincibly, becauſe <hi>Caſtille</hi> was neither delivered from the Tyranny of the <hi>Mores,</hi> nor erected into a Monarchy, nor enlarged at the coſt of the <hi>Inſidels,</hi> but by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and other Nations, which the <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes</hi> had drawn thither; and the <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:53255:279"/> were ſo far from diſcouraging them by Laws and Cuſtoms, which fruſtrated them of the Offices and Benefices of the Country, that on the contrary there was a famous example of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the <hi>beloved,</hi> who to hinder <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> from returning into <hi>France,</hi> gave him his Daughter and <hi>Portugal:</hi> That that Prince, whoſe memory was ſo precious to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the other wiſe Founders of the Monarchy of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> would have gone directly contrary to their own intereſts, if they had acted otherwiſe, ſeeing their Subjects not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to inhabit the Countries, which from time to time they recovered from the <hi>Mores,</hi> nor to maintain them; if they had reſerved the Magiſtracies and Revenues of the Church for the Native <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> they would have encouraged but a few to become their Country-men: Whereas by admitting indifferently to the Offices and Benefices of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as Natives, they engaged them to their Country, by the ſame bonds that they themſelves were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to it. That the ſame conduct was no leſs neceſſary in reſpect of Silver and Gold, ſeeing it was known that moſt part of the exceſſive ſumms which the Kings of <hi>Caſtille</hi> had ſpent in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:53255:280"/> were not drawn neither from the Revenue of the Crown, nor out of the purſes of their ſubjects, but had been furniſhed by the voluntary contributions of ſtrangers concerned in the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian Religion; and that theſe ſtrangers would not have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they did for many Ages, their liberalities, if the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much Gold and Silver from other people, had been ſo ungrateful, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none of it to return back into the places from whence it came.</p>
            <p>By this diſcourſe <hi>Zumel</hi> found that the Mine had taken vent, and ſpent no more time in maintaining, that the Articles in queſtion were not novel. He turned the affair another way; and only told <hi>Chievres,</hi> that if the thing were rightly taken, neither he nor his Nephew were any way concerned in it: That a long while ago their Letters of Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had paſt in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and that his great places of high <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> high <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Steward</hi> of the Kings Houſe, and Head of the <hi>Council,</hi> were in no danger, no more than the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> to which his Nephew was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: That <hi>Caſtille</hi> being for the future to be the Center of the Monarchy of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> it were fit that it ſhould
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:53255:280"/> have ſome priviledge more than the other Dominions, which in reſpect of it would only be lookt upon as Provinces; and that it deſired no other, but that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Caſtillians</hi> might be aſſured of their Offices, Benefices, their Gold and Silver, and the wealth that might come to them from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> could not endure the opinion that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of him, as if inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt were capable to ſway him. He cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly replied to <hi>Zumel,</hi> that he well knew, that neither he nor his Nephew had any way ſolicited for the Letters of Naturalization whereof he ſpake, and that they had been ſent to him before ever it had entred his thoughts to ſue for them: That he thought it not proper to ſlight them, ſeeing they gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſerving his Maſter in <hi>Spain</hi> with the ſame priviledges that he had ſerved him in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but that he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued them not ſo much as to prefer them before the intereſts of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whom they would ſo far debaſe, as to impoſe upon him Articles to be ſworn to, which they never durſt have offered to the Kings his Predeceſſors, even when they were no more but barely Kings of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That if his word might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Catholick King would let them
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:53255:281"/> ſee that he was the moſt powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that if till then he could be very well without them, he could for the future make them comply with their duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zumel</hi> being convinced by ſo ſmart and firm a reply, that he had driven <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> too far, eſſayed to ſoften him again, and prayed him to find out an expedient, which on the one hand might not too much choak the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> and on the other ſhould not too far engage the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King; and <hi>Chievres</hi> having well conſidered on't, propoſed one which was accepted. It was that the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ſhould indeed preſent Articles to be ſigned by the King, wherein the two in debate ſhould be inſerted, but that his Catholick Majeſty ſhould only ſwear in general, to obſerve them in the manner that his Predeceſſors had been obliged to it. The Oath was taken on both parts with this qualification; and ſo ſoon as the Eſtates were diſmiſſed, on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>February,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and eighteen, <hi>Chievres</hi> adviſed the King, that then was the juncture for ſending the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> his only Brother into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Germany;</hi> and that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed it longer, it would be far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:53255:281"/> for him to be acknowledged King by the <hi>Arragoneſe,</hi> it being the humour of that people to have a great reſpect for the Princes of the Royal Family, when they were preſent, and eaſily forget them when abſent. The Fleet for tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him was ready; and the Catholick King having viſited the <hi>Infanto</hi> at <hi>ARan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and kept him ſometime at Court, told him, that it was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the grandeur of their Family, that he ſhould go to the Emperor their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who, according to the opinion of Phyſicians, could not live above a year longer: That the preſence of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty in <hi>Spain</hi> was neceſſary for two or three years at leaſt; and that if neither of the two of the Grandſons of his Imperial Majeſty were with him at his death, it was to be feared that the <hi>Germans</hi> might not chuſe one of them for his Succeſſor; and if the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> loſt the Empire, it could not long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Hereditary Provinces belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: That beſides, it was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more proper that the <hi>Infanto</hi> ſhould be then in <hi>Germany,</hi> than that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King ſhould; ſeeing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty being reſolved to give him theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces for his ſhare, the Electors who would look upon him as a Prince of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Infanto</hi> liſtened not to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with that ſubmiſſion which the Hiſtorians of <hi>Spain</hi> attribute unto him. He complained of the inhumanity that was uſed towards him: He affirmed that it came near to that of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors in regard of their younger Brothers: He upbraided his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that having taken from him the Crowns of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would alſo deprive him of the only comfort that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to him, which was the hopes of ſucceeding to him one time or other: He ſeemed to ſlight the ſhare that was propoſed to him: He exaggerated the diſproportion, or to ſay better, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious difference betwixt the allowance of the Hereditary Provinces, and the lot of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the violence that was done to him, and threatning upon the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reſent it: But all the notice that was taken of him, was to let him ſafely diſcharge his Choler. There was no other anſwer made to him, but that he muſt obey; and that if he ſtayed till he
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:53255:282"/> were by force ſent out of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would expoſe himſelf to the danger of obtaining neither the Hereditary Provinces, nor any thing elſe for his ſhare.</p>
            <p>None dread poverty ſo much, as they who being upon the point of poſſeſſing vaſt Eſtates, are diſappointed of them by ſudden and unexpected accidents; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their diſtracted imagination never fails to repreſent to them, that the ſtate wherein they are, is not ſo far diſtant from miſery, as the mediocrity which they enjoy is from the plentifulneſs they thought themſelves ſure of. The <hi>Infanto,</hi> before he was fourteen years of Age, ſaw himſelf within a ſtep of the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> He had fallen from his ſo well-grounded hopes by a meer trick of two or three Miniſters of State with the Catholick King his Grandfather: In lieu of that he was offered the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Provinces, with hopes of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princeſs of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment was far inferiour to that wherewith he had been ſo long flattered; but after all, it was better to have that, ſuch as it was, than to have nothing at all; and in that conſideration only the <hi>Infanto</hi> ſubmitted to his Brothers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch a manner, as nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared outwardly of the conſtraint he felt within.</p>
            <pb n="548" facs="tcp:53255:283"/>

The Count of <hi>Buce,</hi> a near kinſman to <hi>Chievres,</hi> had the chief place in it, and the reſt were only conferred upon thoſe whom he thought moſt deſerving. The <hi>Infanto</hi> ſailed to <hi>Flanders</hi> with a fair wind, and ſtayed but a ſhort while there. He haſtened to the Imperial Court, where, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel of this Hiſtory, he found the ſame fortune, that he had met with in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> his eldeſt Siſter was already marriageable; and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, who had carried her with him from <hi>Flanders,</hi> thought of diſpoſing of her in marriage. She was beautiful, and would bring with her into the Houſe wherein ſhe ſhould Marry, the hopes of ſucceeding to all the Dominions of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> failing her two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> her Aunt, had taken the care of her Education, and had inſpired into her ſuch early reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:53255:283"/> of ſacrificing her ſelf for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of her Family, as ſtuck to her ſo long as ſhe lived. The Catholick King, her elder Brother, had no ready money to give her: Nevertheleſs in one and the ſame Family ſhe had two Lovers that deſerved her, who offered to take her without putting her Brother to any trouble for a Portion. We have taken notice before, that <hi>Manuel</hi> King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Eſpouſed in firſt marriage his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews Widow, eldeſt Siſter to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Catholick King, by whom he had a Son, who if he had lived, would have put by the Catholick King from the ſucceſſions of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon.</hi> But the Mother dying of her firſt Child, and the Child not ſurviving her above two years, <hi>Manuel</hi> for his ſecond Wife married the Siſter of his former, younger than the Catholick Kings Mother, by whom he had five Sons and four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. She alſo had left him a Widower at the Age of forty nine years; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not of the humour to ſpend the reſt of his life in Widowhood, he courted for a third Wife the elder Siſter of the Catholick King, and Niece to his two former Wives: But he was rivall'd by his own eldeſt Son <hi>John Infanto</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who pretended to the <hi>Infanta
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:53255:284"/> Leonora</hi> upon better ground, as being of the ſame Age with her. So that the Catholick King was to chuſe Father or Son, which he pleaſed; and <hi>Chievres</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him in favour of the Father, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to him, that if he took the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> for his Brother-in-law, he could draw no aſſiſtance from him when he ſtood in need of it for canvaſſing for the Empire; it being the cuſtom of <hi>Portugal</hi> that the eldeſt Sons of the Kings had no more ſubſiſtence but their Fathers Table, with a ſmall Penſion, until the Law of Nature and of the State called them to the Crown. That in the mean time they ate with their Fathers; their Servants of whom they had but a ſmall number, were payed with the Kings; and that they received for Cloaths and their ſmall pleaſures but about a thouſand Crowns a month: Whereas <hi>Manuel</hi> being the King of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> that had moſt money, and having been governed by his two former Wives, he would give the third no leſs dominion over him; and would not have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to refuſe her when ſhe ſhould deſire him to lend the King her Brother the vaſt ſumms of money that he would ſtand in need of, for diſpoſing the more ſcrupulous Electors to give him their Voices.</p>
            <pb n="551" facs="tcp:53255:284"/>
            <p>The Catholick King being prevailed upon by that Argument, employed <hi>Chievres</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to prefer the Father before the Son, and <hi>Chievres</hi> for compleating what he had begun, had no more to do, but to take the <hi>Infanta</hi> by her weak ſide, which was ambition. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her that <hi>Manuel,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amongſt the Pictures of</hi> Portugal.</note> who had always been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the handſomeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of his Age, had not as yet loſt any of his perſonal Charms: That few men of his Age matched him in vigour: That he had all the ſigns of a long life, and by conſequence the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> muſt wait long before he could come to the Crown: That the Princeſs that ſhould marry him would be in danger of never being Queen; whereas ſhe that married his Father, would be ſure of it the firſt day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infanta Leonora</hi> was of the Age wherein Maids are only taken with what gliſters to their Eyes: She conſidered nothing but the outſide of Royalty, was charmed with it, and fancied that ſhe could not too ſoon be a Queen. So ſhe willingly fell into the ſnare that <hi>Chievres</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid for her, and conſented to marry <hi>Manuel.</hi> She was not long left in that
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:53255:285"/> inclination without giving her ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for fear ſhe might change her mind; and ſhe was Crowned the ſame day ſhe was married by Proxy, though it was ſtill the cuſtom to delay ſuch Ceremonies till the Marriage were in effect conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</p>
            <p>The Catholick King being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his Brother and elder Siſter, went merrily into <hi>Arragon,</hi> where he found a freſh the uſefulneſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that <hi>Chievres</hi> had given him, of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with all expedition, and by all means, the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> out of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Eſtates of <hi>Arragon</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> in the Palace of the Archbiſhop, made greater difficulty of acknowledging the Catholick King for their King during the life of the Queen his Mother, than the Eſtates of <hi>Caſtille</hi> had done. They demanded in the firſt place, that they might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give their Oath at the ſame time to the <hi>Infanto Ferdinand,</hi> as preſumptive Heir of their Monarchy; and it was the more poſitively refuſed them, that it was ſeen that they thereby ſought a pretext of revolting when they pleaſed, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to put in execution afterwards the Orders of the Catholick King, that might in the leaſt ſeem uneaſie to them,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53255:285"/> upon the only account that the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Infanto</hi> might be wanting to them.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates ſolicited that Article with ſo much zeal, as made it viſible, that they would never have yielded in it, had that young Prince been ſtill in <hi>Spain:</hi> And the truth is, they yielded not till it was ſlily inſinuated to them, that their efforts were ſo far from recalling the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanto</hi> back into <hi>Spain,</hi> that they would hinder him from ever ſetting foot there again, as it happened.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſition which they added to the former, had no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. They condeſcended to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Catholick King; but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſhould be as Guardian and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator of the Eſtates of his Mother, during her infirmity, and not in quality of King. It was eaſie to be ſeen, that their deſign was to Reign amongſt themſelves during the life of the Queen, and the Grandees of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who had in honour to the Catholick King waited on him to <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> were ſo ſcandalized at it, that ſome of them went to words about it with the Deputies of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and raiſed quarrels, which occaſioned bloud-ſhed: But at length <hi>Chievres</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed them; and the Catholick King

            <p>The <hi>Infanto Ferdinand</hi> being come to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> moved him with pity at his miſery, and affected him with the ſame ſentiments that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick had heretofore had for him. His Imperial Majeſty reſolved to make over to him the Territories which the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to aſſure to him the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Empire. He needed the conſent of the Catholick King for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in execution the firſt of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but not of the ſecond, and that made him delay the one, that he might mind the other.</p>
            <p>The Diet was ſummoned at <hi>Auſbourg,</hi> againſt the end of the year one thouſand
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53255:287"/> five hundred and eighteen, and there was not much oppoſition expected to be made in it by the Electors of the Empire: For though <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was born in <hi>Spain,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> it was not to be doubted, but that he would become <hi>German</hi> by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to which his Brother would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, of abandoning to him the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Provinces of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> for ſupporting the Imperial Dignity, if the <hi>Infanto</hi> were promoted to it: But the friends whom <hi>Chievres</hi> had made in the Empire, gave him timely enough notice of what was hatching to the prejudice of the Catholick King, for him to diſcompoſe the meaſures of it.</p>
            <p>The Relations agree not about the perſon, who was employed to Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with <hi>Maximilian</hi> on the part of his Catholick Majeſty, to perſwade him to change his inclinations. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> name the Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Flemings</hi> chuſe rather to attribute it to the Cardinal of <hi>Sion:</hi> But to which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of theſe two Prelates the inſtruction was addreſſed, it is certain <hi>Chiovres</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and gave the reaſons of it the full extent, of which this is the ſumm. He alledged that the Emperor was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinced of the deſigns of the
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:53255:288"/> houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſince the eſtabliſhment thereof in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> not to attempt any thing that might in the leaſt obſtruct them; and he was only prayed to obſerve, that it was altogether neceſſary for the accompliſhing of them, that the whole power of that Houſe ſhould be united in one ſingle perſon. That the Catholick King was already ſo conſiderable, by the prodigious number, and vaſt extent of his Dominions, that he wanted nothing but the Empire to ſet him above all other Chriſtian Princes, and by conſequence to give them the Law when he thought fit to do it: Whereas if the Empire eſcaped him, the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, would be his equal, and the counter-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>France</hi> would keep him ſo long as he lived from making himſelf greater. That his Imperial Majeſty had before his Eyes an example which he was the more obliged to imitate, that he was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more concerned in it than he that gave it. That it was ſo much the leſs neceſſary for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to chuſe for his Succeſſor the eldeſt of his Grandſons, that his Family, which was that of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ended in him, and the eldeſt of his Grandſons was alſo leſs able to reſtore it than the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53255:288"/> and beſides, he had brought up the younger, and had never ſeen the elder. Nevertheleſs he had preferred the elder before the younger upon no other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but that <hi>Spain</hi> would thereby become more powerful; and that ſo <hi>Maximilian</hi> ought the more indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſtick to the preference of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King for the Empire, that he would be revived more gloriouſly in him than in the perſon of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and that his name and Arms would then more effectually be employed for the ruine of Infidels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who had all his life long been inconſtant, as hath been already obſerved, was ſo ſtill in the laſt of his moſt important actions; and was ſo after his own way, that is to ſay, in a very odd and whimſical manner. He was born with qualities both of body and mind quite contrary to thoſe of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick: He had a ſtrange Antipathy to him; and it was enough heretofore to have taken him off of any action, to tell him that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had done ſo: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the example which for a long time he had abominated, ſeemed charming to him now; and he affected to imitate him when dead, whom he deteſted whilſt alive. He was not ſatisfied only
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:53255:289"/> to renounce the deſign he had of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the younger of his Grandſons to the Empire: But farther, it is the opinion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the dignity of King of the <hi>Romans</hi> for the elder, if Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenths Legat in <hi>Germany</hi> had not oppoſed it by orders from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who had diſcovered the intriegue, and enjoyned his Miniſter to croſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> loſt no time during the ſix months that <hi>Maximilian</hi> lived after the Diet of <hi>Auſbourg.</hi> He ſupplied him with money, to the end he might entertain him in favourable diſpoſitions towards the Catholick King; and ſo skilfully made his advantage of the extraordinary paſſion that <hi>Manuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had for his third Wife, that he drew from him two hundred thouſand Crowns, which was ſufficient to buy the Empire, ſo well that money was employed. The diſcontents of the Cardinal <hi>de la Mark,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> and of Colonel <hi>Seguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> had alienated them from the King of <hi>France.</hi> The buſineſs was to engage them in the intereſts of the King o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> ſucceeded in it more eaſily than he thought he could: But he had a very hard work on't, to diſpoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>Chievres</hi> was perſwaded, that the Catholick King could not have too much of the intriegues of the Cardinal and Colonel for obtaining the Dignity he canvaſſed for, and the event made it appear, that he was not miſtaken. He laboured long to oblige them to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to one another the meaſures that they had already taken, and thoſe which they ſhould take for the future; and he had hardly ſurmounted the difficulties that he found in it, when <hi>Maximilian</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, about the beginning of the year one thouſand five hundred and nineteen.

            <p>It was already eighteen years ſince the unfortunate <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> only Son and Heir of the laſt King of <hi>Naples,</hi> of the baſtard branch of <hi>Arragon,</hi> had been detained in <hi>Spain</hi> in a kind of Priſon, which, though it was gentile, was nevertheleſs ſtrict enough.

<pb n="562" facs="tcp:53255:291"/> circumſpection, that nothing eſcaped him that could give them the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: But it is certain, that he had all along carried himſelf like a man, who had wholly forgot what he was, and minded nothing but to ſatisfie himſelf in two things; the one never to engage in any affair that was in the leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and perplexing; and the other to take his pleaſure as often as ever he found occaſion for it. <hi>Chievres,</hi> who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him too much taken up in an eaſie and ſoft way of living, to fear that he would change his courſe, was of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he ſhould be married to Queen <hi>Germana.</hi> His reaſons were, that they would make the beſt matched couple in <hi>Spain;</hi> and that the Queen would be ſo far from taking the Duke off of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that ſhe would engage him more deeply in them: That ſhe would ſpare the publick the charges of Spies about him; and that he might ſafely be left upon his word, if once he had ſuch a Wife: That they would live together free from cares; and that neither of them would ever think of troubling the publick peace, provided their Penſions for life, on which they ſubſiſted, and which were all their Revenues, were duly paid them: That it was thought ſtrange all over <hi>Europe,</hi>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:53255:291"/> that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> ſhould have obliged the Duke, whether he would or not, to lead a ſingle life; and that for avoiding the ſame reproach, he ought to give him a Wife, by whom there was no fear that he would have any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>The Catholick King approved the propoſition, and <hi>Chievres</hi> had orders from his Majeſty to move it to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The Duke was raviſhed at it, and the Queen ſeemed only to ſcruple the matter, for fear of loſing her rank: But that was removed, by aſſuring her ſhe ſhould not; and the expedient that was uſed for that end was, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>THOUGH the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſtood Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for the Empire, in their competition tranſgreſſed not the terms of civility; it was nevertheleſs to be ſeared, that it would breed ill bloud, and ſow the ſeeds of enmity betwixt <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, which might laſt as long as themſelves; and trouble the repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> at leaſt during the life of one of the two, if they deſcended not to their poſterity. <hi>Francis,</hi> by being baffled in his pretenſions, received the rudeſt check of Fortune that could befal him; and what care ſoever he took, both in his actions, and by Letters to his Ambaſſadors in Courts abroad to diſguiſe it, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Letters of</hi> Francis I. <hi>in</hi> 1519.</note> it was nevertheleſs diſcernable, that
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:53255:293"/> it would not be long before he meaſured the length of Swords with his Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for no other reaſon than that he had been more fortunate than himſelf.</p>
            <p>The truth is, <hi>Charles</hi> had not the ſame cauſes of diſcontent, but he had others of jealouſie, that no leſs animated him to the ruine of <hi>Francis.</hi> He wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now at Nineteen years of Age, but Reputation, and his deſign was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. He could not do it, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring War againſt <hi>Solyman</hi> Emperor of the Turks: For beſides, that he muſt have abſolutely left reſiding in <hi>Spain,</hi> and fixt his ſetled abode in <hi>Germany,</hi> to which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never have conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was to be feared, that the moſt Chriſtian King and <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> might have recovered from him the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> when they ſaw him engaged with the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
            <p>It was then more difficult for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to refrain from exerciſing his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſpoſition againſt <hi>France;</hi> and that Prince was the more inclinable to it, that he expected a more eaſie ſucceſs therein; ſeeing if good fortune wherewith he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf proved ſo favourable to him, as to bring <hi>France</hi> under his ſubjection, it would have been nothing to him to
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:53255:293"/> conquer the reſt of Chriſtendom, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the <hi>Turks:</hi> Whereas beginning with the <hi>Turks,</hi> he would give the <hi>French</hi> leiſure to render themſelves ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it would be in vain for him to attack them thereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gouffier</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> were the two who knew the inclinations of <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> the beſt. They were too ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted not to foreſee the effects thereof in their full extent, and too religious not to uſe their endeavours to prevent them. And, indeed, they procured from their Maſters unlimited Commiſſions, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintain them in good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning the differences that were betwixt them about <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> but alſo to prevent all cauſes of miſunderſtanding, which the change of time and the malice of men might for the future raiſe to diſturb their friendſhip. They met in the Town of <hi>Montpellier</hi> in <hi>Languedock,</hi> in the beginning of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, one thouſand five hundred and nineteen; and it is not doubted, but that they would have concluded a Peace of long duration betwixt the two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, if God, who thought fit to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe the <hi>French</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> had not broken up the Negotiation by the death of <hi>Gouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier.</hi>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:53255:294"/> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> writers, who here do double their calumnies againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Chievres,</hi> have not been ſenſible that they wronged themſelves more than him. They blame him in the firſt place, for having accepted a <hi>French</hi> Town for the interview, and for not having ſtood upon it, that the Conferences ſhould be held upon the Frontiers of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: But it is eaſie to anſwer them, that a neutral place had been good, if there had been open War betwixt the two Crowns. But ſeeing at that time they were in Peace, and that a rupture betwixt them was only to be feared for the future, it was not the cuſtom to uſe any caution for the place of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and though it had been, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was decided in the preceding Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The ſame Plenipotentiaries met in the Town of <hi>Noyon</hi> in <hi>Picardie,</hi> for the ſame reaſon that obliged <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Caſtille</hi> to paſs the River <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſloa,</hi> and Treat in <hi>Guyenne</hi> with <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> that is to ſay, by reaſon of the pre eminence of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, before that of <hi>Spain,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had ſupervened ſince that which exempted <hi>Gouffier</hi> and <hi>Chievres</hi> from that rule: For <hi>Charles</hi> was only Empero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Elect, and not Crowned; and though
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:53255:294"/> he had, the Imperial Dignity hindering not, but that he held the Counties of <hi>Flanders, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> in Fee of the moſt Chriſtian King, the leaſt thing he owed to his Lord ſuperior was, to ſend his Plenipotentiary into his Country.</p>
            <p>The ſame writers in the ſecond place, accuſe <hi>Chievres</hi> of having imprudently truſted himſelf in a Town of <hi>Languedock,</hi> where he was not in full liberty to Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate as was neceſſary: But they mention not that <hi>Chievres</hi> could not take more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity than he did; and that it was ſo far from being violated, that the Biſhop of <hi>Badajox</hi> and Doctor <hi>Carvajal,</hi> who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded him in the Negotiation of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> never complained of it. Laſtly, they find fault in the third place, that <hi>Chievres</hi> put himſelf in danger of being ſtopt, when the Conferences ended, by the death of <hi>Gouffier;</hi> and their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that particular is the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they ſee not that the fault which they impute to <hi>Chievres</hi> reflects upon <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who twenty years after put himſelf into the hands of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt, by croſſing over all <hi>France</hi> upon the word of that Prince, upon no other motive, but the appeaſing of the tumult of <hi>Ghent.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="570" facs="tcp:53255:295"/>
            <p>What the ſame writers add, that <hi>Chievres</hi> had been Arreſted in <hi>Montpellier</hi> if he had not left it at the very inſtant that he heard of the death of <hi>Gouffier,</hi> and eſcaped with all diligence to <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> is no truer than the reſt: For it appears by the Journal of the Conferences, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Secretary <hi>Robertet,</hi> who was preſent at them, that <hi>Chievres</hi> ſtayed in <hi>Montpellier</hi> ſome days after the death of <hi>Gouffier;</hi> that he paid his laſt duties to his friend: That he did not break up the Conferences, but becauſe the power of concluding for <hi>France</hi> was committed ſolely to <hi>Gouffier,</hi> who was dead; and that before he departed he took leave of <hi>Poucher,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans, Robertet</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> who were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaty of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern Miniſters.</p>
            <p>He had one cauſe to regret the death of <hi>Gouffier,</hi> which he had not foreſeen; and which all the advantages that <hi>Charles</hi> obtained afterwards over <hi>France,</hi> were not able to repair. <hi>Gouffier</hi> promiſed <hi>Chievres</hi> to procure for him from the moſt Chriſtian King, peaceable poſſeſſion of the Eſtate of <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> which Queen <hi>Germana</hi> had made over to him; and the thing had infallibly been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed after the ſeparation of the Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:53255:295"/> and the ſigning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. But theſe well-grounded hopes ſo totally evaniſhed by the death of <hi>Gouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,</hi> that whatever <hi>Chievres</hi> could do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the Eſtate that <hi>Gaſton</hi> had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, was given to his three Couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germans by the Fathers ſide, <hi>Lautrec, Aſparant,</hi> and the <hi>Mareſchal de Foix,</hi> without any recompence made to the Heirs of <hi>Chievres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The unſucceſsfulneſs of the Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Montpellier</hi> obliged the Catholick King to uſe as great caution before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if the <hi>French</hi> had already declared War againſt him. He appointed a whole Army for the Guard of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and haſtened his Voyage for <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might engage in his intereſts <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Uncle, by touching at <hi>England.</hi> He durſt not leave a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> to govern the Country in his abſence, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which diverted his Grandfather upon his death-bed from chuſing one of them; and ſeeing he had occaſion to make uſe of <hi>Chievres</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going, and that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as hath been ſaid, caſt his eyes upon the Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging that office in conjunction with <hi>Ximenes,</hi> he thought it his beſt to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:53255:296"/> him both in gratitude and civility. He had no regard in that particular to the Remonſtrances which were made to him thereupon by the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> on the other, when he aſſembled them with deſign to bid them farewel; and the Agents whom he entertained at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> having given him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight would be at <hi>Calais</hi> the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty, for an interview with <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, near the Town of <hi>Ardres,</hi> he apprehended, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that theſe two Monarchs might unite againſt him. In that caſe <hi>England</hi> would have caſt the balance to the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> and upon the account only to take the King of <hi>England</hi> off of that, he haſtened his departure out of <hi>Spain.</hi> He embarked in the Port of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugna,</hi> the twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> and was ſo happy as to make his Voyage into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with ſo much expedition, as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to break the moſt Chriſtian Kings meaſures with <hi>Wolſey,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> the Favourite of <hi>Henry.</hi> A favourable Wind in ſix days time brought him in the very nick to <hi>Dover,</hi> where he found the Court of <hi>England</hi> making ready to go over into <hi>France.</hi> He conferred two
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:53255:296"/> whole days with <hi>Henry,</hi> none being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but <hi>Chievres</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> the two chief Miniſters of the two Princes; and the effects of extraordinary civilities in interviews appeared as much in that rencounter as ever. It ſeemed that the Catholick King had forgot that he was choſen Emperor, ſo reſpectful he was to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Majeſty; and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance condeſcended ſo far, as to call the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> Father, though he was not ignorant that that Prelate was a Butchers Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres,</hi> who had taught him the art of inſinuating into the affections of men, ſeconded him ſo well; that if the Court of <hi>England</hi> could with honour not have gone over to <hi>Calais,</hi> it would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately returned to <hi>London.</hi> But mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being now too far advanced; and the Court of <hi>France</hi> being already in the Frontiers of <hi>Picardie,</hi> the Emperor was ſatisfied with the promiſe that the King of <hi>England</hi> his Uncle gave him, not to conclude any thing to his diſadvantage at <hi>Ardres,</hi> whither he was going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the moſt Chriſtian King, and afterwards to grant his Imperial Majeſty a ſecond interview, wherein an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and Defenſive League betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſhould be Negotiated. The
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:53255:297"/> promiſe was fulfilled in its whole extent: The Conferences of <hi>Ardres</hi> ended; and no new engagement entered into by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with <hi>France: Henry</hi> received a ſecond viſit from the Emperor, ſo ſoon as he had diſpatched his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Germany;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Treaties betwixt</hi> Charls <hi>the Fifth and</hi> Henry <hi>the Eight.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> ſo effectually perſwaded his Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> that it was his intereſt to have the <hi>French</hi> driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> that he promiſed in writing to contribute to it.</p>
            <p>The fruit that <hi>Spain</hi> reaped from that, was the conqueſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan:</hi> But <hi>Chievres,</hi> who lived not to ſee it, lived long enough to ſee himſelf le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at by the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe,</hi> in the ſtrangeſt manner that a Subject could be, without falling. It hath been already obſerved, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not endure that he ſhould be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of their Council and their Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; and that it was chiefly to deprive him of thoſe two Offices, that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fruſtrate ſtrangers of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Benefices of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had taken ſo little notice of it, that they were offended thereat; and ſeeing his Voyage into <hi>Germany,</hi> in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, furniſhed a ſingular occaſion of ſnatching from his Imperial Majeſty by
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:53255:297"/> force, what he would not grant them by fair means, they engaged into a revolt for the ſpace of two years, by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degrees.</p>
            <p>The great men of the Country, by their Emiſſaries and Agents, diſpoſed the Burghers and Country people of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,</hi> firſt to complain in ſecret, and then openly, that their Laws were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and no regard had to their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: That in leſs than three years time the <hi>Flemings</hi> had plundered <hi>Spain,</hi> and tranſmitted into their Country ſo much robb'd and ſtoln money, as amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſumm of ſix millions of Livres: That no Office nor Benefice eſcaped them, ſeeing if either the one or other were convenient for them, they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated them; and if they were not, they procured grants of them for ſuch of the Native <hi>Spaniards</hi> as offered them moſt mony: That hitherto it had been ſuffered, not only out of the reverence that they had for the Catholick King, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed, that his Majeſty would condeſcend to the prayers, and be moved with the Remonſtrances of his moſt humble Subjects, who begg'd him to deliver them from thoſe Leeches: But now that he was gone to <hi>Germany,</hi> and had abandoned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:53255:298"/> of the ſame <hi>Flemings,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the infinite number of Petitions that had been preſented to him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there was no other remedy for the evils which <hi>Spain</hi> actually ſuffered, and for thoſe wherewith it was threatned, but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves ſhould put in execution, during the abſence of their King, what could not juſtly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, that is to ſay, by their own Forces to recover their ancient Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The Burghers of the Towns of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſia</hi> moved at theſe diſcourſes, were the firſt that mutinied, and in leſs than a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights time, the revolt was propagated in the other Kingdoms of <hi>Spain.</hi> They refuſed to receive the Orders of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> and the City of <hi>Segovia</hi> had the boldneſs to declare againſt them. The Cardinal thinking to quiet the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by dividing the power that had been given him, with Native <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhared it firſt with the Conſtable, and afterwards with the Admiral of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> But the Seditious, who had now obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of what they demanded, without drawing a Sword, abuſed the eaſineſs of the Cardinal, and preſt him with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heat than before to be gone out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to carry with him all the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> who were there.</p>
            <pb n="577" facs="tcp:53255:298"/>
            <p>That inſtance was too audacious to be ſuffered; and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom the Emperor had left to be Counſellors to the Cardinal, thought it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily puniſhed; and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for doing it ought to be given to the boldeſt and ſevereſt Provoſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was the <hi>Aclayde Ronchillo.</hi> Upon that advice the Cardinal gave him Troops, and commanded him to reduce the <hi>Segovians</hi> to their duty. <hi>Ronchillo</hi> put it in execution the more punctually, that the Order which he had received agreed beſt with his temper. He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtreight to <hi>Segovia,</hi> commanded the Burghers in a haughty manner to open the Gates to him; threatned them with utmoſt extremity if they delayed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; took the deſire of ſome hours to deliberate in, which they made to him, as a premeditated refuſal; inſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Judiciary procedures preſcribed by the Laws of <hi>Caſtille</hi> in ſuch caſes; haſtened the concluſion of them; and had no ſooner finiſhed his verbal Proceſſes, but that he executed the Cardinals Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders more like a common Executioner than a Commiſſary.

            <p>The Burghers of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who waited only for a plauſible pretext for an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, took that of the Military execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were practiſed in their neighbourhood; and went out to put a ſtop to them, with the greater licentiouſneſs, that as yet they had not a head, their young Archbiſhop being gone with the Emperor. They met <hi>Rouchillo</hi> when the Officers were in a negligent poſture, not apprehending that they had any to fight with, but thoſe whom they ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed: They defeat him; returned back in triumph within their walls; and that firſt advantage was enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage into a publick Rebellion the Towns of <hi>Burgos, Vailladolid, Salamanca, Avila, Zamorra, Leon,</hi> and <hi>Toro.</hi> The Great men, who had Eſtates in their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, followed their example; and the Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> who had choſen <hi>Vailladolid</hi> for the place of his ordinary reſidence, and for the ſitting of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that was left with him, not being able to hinder the Town from confederating with the reſt, thought he could not with honour continue there. He pretended to yield to the entreaties of <hi>Pedro Giron,</hi> and <hi>John de Padilla,</hi> who came to wait on him in name of the Inhabitants, to aſſure him that he might ſtay in the houſe
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:53255:302"/> where he was: That neither he nor his Servants ſhould ſuffer any prejudice: That they were perſwaded of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and that they had nothing to ſay againſt him; but he gained a Prieſt, who made his eſcape out of <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> through a hole which he made in the walls that were neareſt to his Garden.</p>
            <p>After he was gone, they cared not for detaining thoſe of his Council; and they only narrowly obſerved the famous <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> to whom the Seditious imputed the cauſe of their calamities, becauſe he had been one of the three who had perſwaded <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick to recal his firſt Teſtament made in favours of the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> It is not known whether it was the deſign of the Burghers of <hi>Vailladolid</hi> only, to make ſure of the perſon of <hi>Vargas,</hi> to keep him for an exchange, in caſe one of the Lords, who had declared for them, ſhould be taken; or that they delayed his puniſhment until the meeting of the Eſtates, which they intended ſhould ſpeedily be called: But it is certain, that <hi>Vargas</hi> impatient of living in ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an uncertainty, ſeaſonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf, that one of the firſt Commiſſions which heretofore he had had from Queen <hi>Iſabelle,</hi> was to cauſe a Sink or common-Sewer in <hi>Vailladolid</hi> to
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:53255:299"/> be ſcoured. He had obſerved that the common-Sewer had been forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly an Aqueduct; and that there was room enough for the paſſage of the Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, who had the care of the Waters, when he went to viſit them. <hi>Vargas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from thence, that perhaps it would not be impoſſible for him to make his eſcape through that paſſage; and he cauſed a trial to be made by one of his skilfulleſt Servants, who having fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately gone through, entred it again with him, and aſſiſted him in paſſing it.</p>
            <p>The revolted Towns ſet up a kind of Republick among themſelves, which gave but too much cauſe to judge, that they would not ſo ſoon lay down their Arms. In <hi>Avila</hi> they eſtabliſhed a Council, much like to that which hath been ſince ſetled in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> Each of them ſent thither a Deputy with a ſufficient power: The high Nobility were invited to be there in perſon, or to ſend ſome in their name: The Lords who had eſpouſed the party, retained their rank; and the others were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt according to the forms of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Law. They were cited to come and take their places in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which was not called, but only for
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:53255:299"/> the deſence of the Laws and Liberty of the Country: Their failing to appear paſſed for a formal refuſe: Thereupon they were proceeded againſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Traitors to their Country. So the Rector of <hi>Segovia</hi> was hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Lords, for having dared to ſay, that he owned not the Aſſembly for lawful. The houſe of <hi>Pedro Poncio,</hi> in the ſame Town of <hi>Avila,</hi> was razed to the Foundation, becauſe he had left it, that he might not be conſtrained to ſign the union. For the ſame reaſon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Alva,</hi> loſt all the Furniture they had in the City of <hi>Burgos;</hi> and the Family of <hi>Guevara</hi> was upon the point of being extirpated, becauſe they would have deliberated, whether or not they ſhould accept the Commiſſions that were given them by the Seditious.</p>
            <p>It was of extream importance for the Rebels to have the Town of <hi>Medina del Campo,</hi> and chance contributed more than they to engage it into their intereſts. The Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> had need of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and the faireſt in all <hi>Spain</hi> were in <hi>Medina.</hi> He ſent Colonel <hi>Fonſeca</hi> to fetch them away, and the Towns-people abſolutely refuſed to part from them in the preſent juncture. <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> who had
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:53255:300"/> not men enough to carry them away by force, uſed a ſtratagem. He cauſed the Town to be ſet on fire in ſeveral quarters, and eſpecially where the richeſt Goods were, thinking that they who moſt withſtood his deſign, would run to the putting out of the fire: But he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſo probable a conjecture; and the Burghers of <hi>Medina</hi> choſe rather to loſe their moſt precious Goods, than to abandon their Artillery. What the fire conſumed was of an ineſtimable value, and yet they priſed it not ſo much, as to ſave it by dividing themſelves. They ſtood to their Arms, as long as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make <hi>Fonſeca</hi> be gone; and then when there was no more danger of him within, they divided themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two almoſt equal bodies, the one was employed for the guard of the walls, and the other run to put out the fire. <hi>Fonſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> who was not ſtrong enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege the Town, thought it enough to ravage the Country about; and when the Inhabitants ſaw themſelves treated as Enemies, they entred into the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy ſo ſoon as the Rebels, to colour their cauſe, were gone to <hi>Tordeſillas;</hi> where their deſign was not ſo much to raiſe Queen <hi>Jean</hi> to the Throne, as to Reign in her name, and to aſperſe their
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:53255:300"/> adverſaries with the crime of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They preſented themſelves before that Princeſs in the poſture of men, who were come expreſly to ſet her at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and ſeeing we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that her ſolly had not at all chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the matter of Ambition, ſhe was ſo overjoyed to ſee her ſelf treated as a Sovereign, that it hindred her from any extravagancies, ſo long as the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious were in her preſence. She received <hi>John Padilla,</hi> who ſpake to her in name of the reſt, with the ſame haughtineſs that ſhe had heretofore ſeen Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle</hi> her Mother receive the Deputies of <hi>Caſtille:</hi> She complained but tranſiently, that ſhe had now been ſixteen years kept priſoner: She imputed the evils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Padilla</hi> told her <hi>Spain</hi> had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, to that horrible diſloyalty of her Subjects: She ſent <hi>Padilla</hi> and the other Deputies to conſult with the Grandees about the means that might be taken to remedy them; and promiſed to approve if ſhe found them juſt.</p>
            <p>They returned two or three days after with an Order which they had drawn up, for all the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Arragoneſe</hi> to joyn in the union, and ſhe ſigned it. Immediately they baniſhed from her the Marqueſs of <hi>Degnia,</hi> who had been ſo

The Biſhop of <hi>Zamorra</hi> was the moſt hot-headed of all the Conſpirators, though he was already threeſcore years of Age.

That Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> had continued it, to keep himſelf from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing under the averſion of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees; and that her Son perſiſted therein for the ſame reaſon, that his maternal Grandfather had done it: But that God, who had not beſtowed the Catholick Queen upon <hi>Spain</hi> to remain always uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to them, had now ſet her at liberty, and that her good and faithful Subjects would quickly ſee the aſtoniſhing effects of her wiſdom in governing them.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> gave the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror advice of all theſe particulars now related, as faſt as they happened; and <hi>Chievres,</hi> who did not think them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous before the Rebels had ſeized the
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:53255:306"/> perſon of the Queen, was of another judgment, when he had intelligence ſent him, that they were Maſters of <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillas.</hi> He was of the opinion, that the Emperor ſhould write to the Cardinal, Conſtable, and Admiral, by all means to compoſe the trouble, and to begin with mildneſs. If the Rebels were not reclaimed by that, they ſhould next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to divide them; and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued firm in their confederacy, they muſt, if poſſible, be fought in a pitched Battel, before they ſhould take full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for a long reſiſtance. The three Governours punctually obeyed; and they made offer to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that for the future no <hi>Fleming</hi> ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any dignity Eccleſiaſtical or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in <hi>Spain,</hi> provided thoſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had ſuch ſhould enjoy them during life. The propoſition was not only reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo called ridiculous; and the Rebels ſtood upon it ſo obſtinately, that all the <hi>Flemings</hi> ſhould forth with be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that now they excepted not <hi>Chievres</hi> as hitherto they had done, nor yet the Cardinal his Nephew. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Zamorra</hi> aſpired to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and there was not one of his liſted Prieſts, who promiſed not to himſelf the firſt vacant Benefice
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:53255:306"/> in the ſame Church. So they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſecond expedient which <hi>Chievres</hi> had propoſed, if the firſt failed, and at firſt they addreſſed themſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Zamorra.</hi> That Prelate told his mind without much ceremony; and aſſured them, that if he renounced the Union, it ſhould only be to be Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Spain.</hi> But that had been a way to reward Rebellion too liberally; and it would have been a precedent of too dangerous conſequence, eſpecially in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the minds of the people being once ſet upon Rebellion, are not ſo eaſily taken off of it as in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They made application in the ſecond place to <hi>Padilla,</hi> who was as untractable as the Biſhop of <hi>Zamorra.</hi> He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Wife, whoſe capricious impiety is too remarkable not to find a place in this Hiſtory. She had need of money to ſend to her Husband, who commanded the Forces of the League; and the Purſes of the Citizens of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where then ſhe was, were drained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext that Queen <hi>Jean</hi> would pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually pay thoſe who had contributed their money for raiſing her to the Throne. The Plate of the Metropolitan Church was ſo well hid by the Treaſurer, who had the care of it, that it had in vain
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:53255:307"/> been ſought for in all places where it could be imagined it was. There was no way of putting that Church-man to the Rack, to make him confeſs where he had put that which was entruſted with him; for beſides, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of his Dignity, and of his Church, protected him from that, the common people would not have ſuffered him to have been Racked. But the Shrines of Reliques were not lock'd up, becauſe it was thought that the San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity of the Bones that were ſhut up in them, would be ſufficient to keep them from being touched, eſpecially ſeeing the Wife of <hi>Padilla</hi> affected an extraordinary devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the good Lady having ſometime conſidered what ſhe had beſt do, thought ſhe had found out a rare expedient, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Sacriledge with Piety. She went ſtreight to the Church, accompanied with the worſt Church-men of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Zamorra,</hi> cloathed in their Prieſtly Habits, and carrying in their hands lighted Torches. She fell upon her knees before the Reliques; made a ſpeech to them; prayed them with joyned hands, not to take it ill that they were ſtript of their Ornaments for a very ſhort time; enlarged upon the reaſons for ſo doing, and ſolemnly ſwore, one day to reſtore
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:53255:307"/> the double of what ſhe was about to take. Afterwards ſhe cauſed the Reliques to be taken out of their Shrines, wrapped up in clean Linen, with Notes in writing, to ſhew what Saints they belonged to, put up again into the preſſes after they had been cenſed, and having carried away the Shrines, turned them into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It was no eaſie matter to reclaim a woman that was come to that exceſs; and <hi>Padilla,</hi> to whom ſhe had been a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaera,</hi> if he had dared to have liſtened to propoſals of agreement without her, with her conſent demanded the great Maſtery of <hi>S. James,</hi> without which he muſt not renounce the confederacy. To this purpoſe he ſpake to thoſe who founded him in name of the Governours; and it was to no purpoſe to repreſent to him, that the Dignity which he deſired was annexed to the Crown, not to be ſeparated from it: That he knew not what he demanded: That his King would be jealous of him, ſo ſoon as he ſhould be great Maſter; and that he would never quietly poſſeſs what he had obtained by the Sword. He continued notwithſtanding ſo firm, that they were forced to try whether <hi>Pedro Giron</hi> might not be more tractable.</p>
            <pb n="590" facs="tcp:53255:308"/>
            <p>They offered him ready money, and the erection of his Lands of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> into a Dutchy; but he made anſwer, that he was of too ancient a Family to be content with a new Dutchy: That that of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Sidonia,</hi> the ancienteſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him in right of his Mother: That he ſhould not fail to be thankful to thoſe who would put him in poſſeſſion of it, but ſo long as he lived he would not loſe his hopes of recovering it. They preſſed him no more at that time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the Emperor, becauſe he went to lead the Rebel Army to the Siege of the Town of <hi>Medina de Rioſecco,</hi> where the Army of the Governours, too weak to keep the Field, was retired. They began there to be in want of Proviſions and Forrage; and there needed no more, but to perſiſt in intercepting their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, to oblige them to render upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, which would have occaſioned the entire loſs of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Emperor; but as he held it of a woman, who was his Mother, ſo it was preſerved to him by another woman, the Counteſs of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was the near Kinſwoman of <hi>Pedro Giron,</hi> and upon that pretext deſired a Conference with him. <hi>Giron</hi> did not think he could civilly refuſe the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:53255:308"/> and having conſulted thoſe of his party, granted it. The Counteſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him, that all her Eſtate lay about <hi>Medina,</hi> and that the Army of the League would utterly ruine it, if they ſtayed a few days longer in the place where they were: That to prevent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, it had come into her mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an accommodation, which ſhe judged to be too reaſonable not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: That the Town of <hi>Medina</hi> was no way conſiderable, but for the Army which defended it, and that it would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways receive the Law from him who ſhould be Maſter of the Field: That if the League had no other intention in ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it, but to take from the contrary party a place of ſo ſmall importance, the Town offered to ſubmit to them, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they would ſuffer thoſe who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated thither to march out: That in the mean time they could not force them out; and that there was no inſtance of a Town defended by an Army of all old Soldiers, that ever was taken by Storm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giron,</hi> who had not experience enough for the Generalſhip that he undertook, ſuffered himſelf to be over-reached by the ambiguity that lay in the propoſition of the Counteſs of <hi>Medina:</hi> For it is true, indeed, that Towns defended by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:53255:309"/> were not expoſed to the danger of being loſt, when theſe Armies found abundance of Proviſions in them, or could have them from other places: But they were not ſo when the Armies were in want, and ſo ſtraitly block'd up, that they could neither enlarge their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor receive Convoys, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that was exactly the caſe of the Imperial Forces in <hi>Medina.</hi> They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had nor could make Magazines there for want of money: They were inveſted by the Army of the League, ſtronger by one half than they; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no relief; and Proviſions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage being equally wanting, they muſt have been forced within a few days to render upon diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Giron</hi> looked upon the propoſition of the Counteſs as moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to his party. He ſpake of it to the Biſhop of <hi>Zamorra;</hi> who being no greater Captain than himſelf, was no leſs taken with it. Theſe two got it to paſs in the Council of War of the League, that the Confederate Army ſhould draw off to <hi>Villalpando,</hi> provided the Imperialiſts marched out of <hi>Medina,</hi> and left it in its own poſſeſſion, and that was the cauſe of their ruine; for the Imperialiſts ſo eaſily delivered from the
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:53255:309"/> danger that their weakneſs in number had put them into, made extraordinary good uſe of the neglect of their Enemy. They marched ſtreight to the Town of <hi>Tordeſillas,</hi> being perſwaded, that if they could get the Queen out of the hands of the Rebels, they would deprive them of the beſt thing they had, and they proceeded with this circumſpection, that they ſtopt and carried along with them all that they met upon the way. So they hindred the Rebels from having any intelligence of their deſign, which they might eaſily have diſappointed if they had diſcovered it.</p>
            <p>The Gariſon of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Tordeſillas</hi> conſiſted chiefly in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Zamorra</hi>'s Prieſts, and in ſome of the Trained bands of the City of <hi>Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladolid.</hi> They were in no preparation to maintain the aſſault that was made about break of day, the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it laſted from morning till night; and never was there before that any place attacked with greater heat, nor defended with more obſtinacy than <hi>Tordeſillas</hi> was, though it was one of the weakeſt places of <hi>Caſtille.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Haro,</hi> an expert Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who commanded the Imperialiſts,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:53255:310"/> perceiving his Infantry diſheartened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had been thrice beaten back, made his Cavalry alight, and led them himſelf to the Aſſault. The Rebels ſtartled not at all at it, and reſiſted with no leſs vigour nor order. A Prieſt, one of the beſt marks-men amongſt them, had placed himſelf behind a Parapet, from whence he never miſſed any of the Aſſailants who clambered up on his ſide, when he ſaw them within diſtance to fire at them. He made the ſign of the Croſs upon them with the But of his Muſquet; and thereby pretended that he gave them the Abſolution of their ſins, and leſſened one half, at leaſt, of the crime he was about to commit: Then he took aim at them, and turned them down dead into the Ditch. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had killed eleven of the boldeſt Imperialiſts; but as he was performing his ridiculous ceremony towards the Twelfth, he received an Arrow-ſhot in the right Eye, of which he died, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that the ſame favour might be done to him which he had done to others.</p>
            <p>About noon the Count of <hi>Haro</hi> deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry the place at that part which he thought was the weakeſt, removed the Attack to the oppoſite ſide. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry diſdaining that the Horſe ſhould
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:53255:310"/> perform their duty, behaved themſelves with greater eagerneſs, and in better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than before. Nevertheleſs both were beaten off till night, when a <hi>Navarreſe</hi> Soldier of <hi>Cadaorra</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the bottom of the Ditch a little door ill guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the relation of the ſecond taking of</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſillas.</note> ſhow'd it to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, who helpt him to break it open with Bars and Levers, and by it entred the Town.</p>
            <p>The reſpect which the Victorious owed to the preſence of the Queen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bragged that they were only come to deliver her out of the hands of Rebels, hindred neither the plundering of <hi>Torde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillas,</hi> nor the other cruelties that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attend it; and that Princeſs took no great exceptions at it, though on all hands ſhe heard moſt dreadful noiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe care was taken not to divert her from her ordinary paſtime, which was to purſue and run after Cats. In the mean time there was never a more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible proof than at this time, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which moſt frequently decides the quarrels in Civil Wars, as well as in Foreign: For the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſtrove who ſhould firſt declare for the League, whilſt they knew that their Queen was with the Confederates, no ſooner came
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:53255:311"/> to underſtand that ſhe was taken from them, but that they fell off in all places where they could ſafely do it.</p>
            <p>The example went even from the ſmall to the great; and <hi>Pedro Giron</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly renounced the League upon a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that he had with the Biſhop of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra,</hi> in which he obtained not that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which he expected from the Council of the Party. His deſertion quite broke the League, and there was hardly any doubt made on't, but that he had raiſed the Siege of <hi>Medina,</hi> with a deſign to betray thoſe whom he forſook ſo ſoon afterward. They were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an opinion ſo diſadvantageous to him, by the manner how the Emperor uſed him thereafter; when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that his Majeſty made rather a ſhew of puniſhing him, than that he really did ſo; notwithſtanding the conſtant and uniform practice of the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> never to ſhow favour to thoſe who have been once engaged in a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. The truth is, he was afterwards ſuffered to live in his Country-houſes, as if he had been confined to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing him liberty to come to Court, or enter into any Town, and that was all the ſeverity uſed towards him. Colonel <hi>Louis Bravo</hi> thought it
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:53255:311"/> not enough in imitation of <hi>Giron</hi> ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to renounce the League; but he went farther, and liſted himſelf under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Banner, becoming the greateſt Enemy of the Faction, which he had had a hand in forming of.</p>
            <p>The Governours being convinced that the League began to decline, wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that an extraordinary effort, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it were ſpeedy, would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ruine it, and in that proſpect ſent for the Forces that guarded <hi>Navarre.</hi> They got ſome alſo from the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> And the high Nobility, who had continued Loyal, lent what money they had; ſo that at length, by ſo many different means, they ſet on foot an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my every way more conſiderable than that of the Confederates. The Count of <hi>Haro</hi> was ſtill General, and marched with his Army ſtreight againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who refreſhed themſelves about <hi>Labaton. John de Padilla</hi> knowing that the Imperialiſts approached; and being informed by his Spies, that they were much ſtronger than he, thought it not fit to expect them in the poſt that he poſſeſt. On the twenty third of <hi>April,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty one, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence in the morning, and with extraordinary diligence advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:53255:312"/> 
               <hi>Toro,</hi> a Town ſtrong by ſituation, thinking that he might have refuge, and continue there until the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable recruits that were coming to him from <hi>Vailladolid</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> had obliged the Imperialiſts to divide their Forces, and ſend ſome to oppoſe them: But he was overtaken by that time he was got half way, and forced to face about. The Light Horſe-men whom the Count of <hi>Haro</hi> ſent after him, about noon came up with the Rear of the Rebels at <hi>Villanar,</hi> and ſtopt them there until the main Body of the Imperialiſts were arrived. <hi>Padil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> who ſtayed in the Rear the better to give Orders in caſe of neceſſity, cauſed his Artillery quickly to be advanced: But <hi>Maldonado,</hi> who commanded it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of obeying, mired it in a ſlough, out of which it was not poſſible to draw it, and fled to the Imperialiſts. Such an unexpected accident put <hi>Padilla,</hi> indeed, out of all hopes of victory, but it dampt not his reſolution to defend himſelf to the laſt breath. At the head of his Rear he maintained the charge of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, which was drawn up in one intire Body; being aſſured that if they broke the Body, which <hi>Padilla</hi> commanded in perſon, the other two would betake themſelves to flight, as it happened.
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:53255:312"/> The Cannon of the Imperialiſts made the more terrible havock, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Guns made no anſwer; and if they had given them but time to charge again, that alone would have been ſufficient to defeat the Confederates. But the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts were ſo furious, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it, nay, and covered their own Artillery; which made the Fight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more bloudy than it would have been, had not their courage ſo tranſported them. <hi>Padilla</hi> was not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his choice of thoſe who fought about him. They fell in Rank and File; and ſo had he in company, but that he was diſcovered by the marks which he had taken to be diſtinguiſhed by, when he gave his Orders to the Rebels. He was ſo particularly taken notice of by the firſt of the Enemies that engaged with him, that they took as much care to ſave his life, as he took to loſe it: They environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſmounted him, and ſeized his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and delivered him to a Guard, who carried him to the next Caſtle, to the place where they Fought. The main Body and Van of his Army being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was taken, made no defence: The Horſe and Foot run for it by conſent, and were purſued three Leagues and a half beyond <hi>Villanar.</hi> This was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:53255:313"/> a victory, that it utterly ruined the League: The leading men of it ſell alive into the hands of the Imperialiſts, and were next day put to death without any form of Proceſs; becauſe the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> pretended that the crime was ſo evident, that there was no need neither of Accuſers, Proofs, Evidence, nor Judges: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the relation of</hi> Nexia.</note> They were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and <hi>Padilla,</hi> who had been their chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, gave them an example of dying couragiouſly.</p>
            <p>Seeing he knew the inexorable temper of his Country-men, he neither deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor expected favour. He delayed not to prepare himſelf for death, till it was intimated to him; and he ſhew'd nothing that was ſingular in the laſt hours of his life, but that as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuffer, having eſpied amongſt the crowd of ſpectators the younger Brother of the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> who made afterward the ſtem of the Counts of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> he called him to him; and prayed him to carry to <hi>Mary Pacheco</hi> of <hi>Mendoſa</hi> his Wife, a Reliquary that he had as the laſt pledge of his Love, though he was not ignorant how ſhe had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reliques of <hi>Toledo.</hi> That Lady abated nothing in her reſolution of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:53255:313"/> on the Rebellion as far as it could go, even when ſhe ſaw her Husband dead, and her party ruined. She cauſed <hi>Padilla</hi> beheaded to be painted upon a pair of Colours; had them carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her the firſt time ſhe went abroad after the news of his Execution; carried in her arms a Son which ſhe had by him in Swath-bands; and in this pitiful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture running up and down the Streets of <hi>Toledo,</hi> took the people off from the reſolution of accepting, as <hi>Vailladolid</hi> and the other neighbouring Towns had done, the pardon that was offered them: She confirmed them in the Seditious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſhe had inſpired into them, and kept them ſo almoſt a year; ſeeing it was not before the third of <hi>February,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty two, when the Imperialiſts having form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a more powerful Faction than hers, by the means of <hi>Melinar,</hi> whom they had gained by the promiſe of a Cardinals Hat, the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Barry,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Songuetta,</hi> which he had afterwards, that <hi>Toledo</hi> all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den returned to its duty. The widow of <hi>Padilla</hi> being abandoned of her party, for her own ſafety invented a wile that ſucceeded with her. She went out of the City mounted on an Aſs, and ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:53255:314"/> into a Country-woman, that thoſe who were ſet at the Gates with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to watch her, let her paſs without knowing her: She took her journey into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and upon the Rode eſcaped a great many dangers. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her civilly enough; and the King <hi>Don Emanuel,</hi> for all he was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Brother-in-law, ſhewed more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity towards her, than ſhe had ground to hope for. He thought the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Portugal</hi> was concerned to give a refuge to that illuſtrious Fugitive; and the inſtances of the Emperors Miniſters to him, to perſwade him to order <hi>Padil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s Widow to look for a retreat elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, were wholly ineffectual. He conſtantly replied, That ſince ſhe had choſen his Dominions for her abode, ſhe ſhould be free to live there as long as ſhe pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Zamorra,</hi> her Couſin, could not be at the Battel, becauſe the Council of the League who expected not that they ſhould have fought ſo ſoon, had ſent him to a place ſome Leagues from thence. Upon the news of the defeat of his party he diſguiſed himſelf, and fled to the Mountains of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> where he abſconded near Eighteen months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding the occaſion which he looked
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:53255:314"/> for, of going into <hi>Portugal.</hi> At the end of that time he was known in a Cottage where he was; there he was Arreſted, and carried to <hi>Simancas,</hi> where he was ſhut up in the Caſtle of that Town, till a Brief might be obtained from the Pope to bring him to a trial. He was in the cuſtody of an <hi>Alcaide,</hi> who treated him with all the reſpect that was due to his character: Nevertheleſs, as they were in diſcourſe together after Dinner, the Biſhop, who had a Knife hid in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Breviary, which was left him, drew it, cloſed with the <hi>Alcaide,</hi> threw him down, cut his Throat; and would have made his eſcape, had not the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caide</hi>'s Son come running at the noiſe timely enough to ſtop him at the outer Gate: They put him hand and foot in Irons; and ſo ſoon as the Brief came, he was put to death in Priſon.</p>
            <p>The Memoires of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of that time agree not about the kind of his death, and make it apparent enough, by the diverſity of their relations, that there was an expreſs order to conceal it: But there are ſome alſo who affirm, that the <hi>Alcaide Ronchillo</hi> was ſent to him, who cauſed him to be thrown down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the Battlements of the Caſtle of <hi>Simancas.</hi> They agree better in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:53255:315"/> the ſad end of <hi>Don Pedro d' Ayala,</hi> Count of <hi>Salvatierra,</hi> Preſident of the Council of the League, who bragg'd to be deſcended from the <hi>Goths</hi> in a ſtreight Line, without any mixture of <hi>Mihome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> bloud, as there was in the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> This is not a place to examine the truth of it; and it is enough that after he had been a long time in the Mountains, where he could find nothing to eat, but at a vaſt charge, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſcribed, and thoſe that ſhould in any way aſſiſt him, becoming acceſſary to his crime, it was no ſmall matter that would make people run the hazard of an Arreſt, by relieving the miſery of the laſt of the Rebels. He was taken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a Dungeon, after he had long languiſhed expecting the death that was intimated unto him. The people knew it not till they ſaw him carried to the Grave bare-footed and bare-faced. <hi>Athanaſius Ayala</hi> his Son, was then actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Emperors Page, and had gone with his Majeſty into <hi>Germany.</hi> There he was informed of the Proſcription, and afterward of the Vagabond life of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſeeing he was of an excellent ſweet diſpoſition, he was ſo moved at it, that he conſidered not the danger of his fortune in aſſiſting him, who had given
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:53255:315"/> him being, in his extream neceſſity. He had a Horſe of conſiderable value, which ſerved him for the great Saddle; he ſold him, got a Bill of Exchange for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and directed it to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he knew to be ſo much his Fathers friend, as to ſend him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney contained in it, in what place ſoever he were. The Governour of the Pages ſeeing young <hi>Ayala</hi> without a Horſe, thought that he had ſold him to get mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to game with. From that miſtake he fell into another, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſerved to find out the truth. He called together the Pages, of whom he had the conduct, who were five and twenty, or thirty in number, and before them all asked <hi>Ayala</hi> what he had done with his Horſe. <hi>Ayala</hi> made no other anſwer, but that he had parted from him, and that it was for no ill end. The ſeverity which the Governour uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him to make him declare himſelf more clearly, could not draw one word more from him; and ſuch an obſtinate ſilence, and ſo unſuitable to the humour of Pages, encreaſed the Governours cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to find out the cauſe of it. He made ſo ſtrict an enquiry into the matter, that he diſcovered all the particulars which we have mentioned.</p>
            <pb n="606" facs="tcp:53255:316"/>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſubtilized more in the point of High Treaſon, than the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers did, and what follows will be able to convince the leaſt credulous of it. The Governour of the Pages thought it would blemiſh his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to know that <hi>Ayala</hi> had ſent money to the Count of <hi>Salvatierra</hi> his Father, if he acquainted not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inſtantly with it. He run and told it his Majeſty, who having praiſed him for his diligence, had a mind to ſearch into the bottom of the affair; but it was with another intent than the Governour imagined. He ſent for the Page, and commanded him in a manner not to be diſobeyed, that he ſhould conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him of his conduct in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof he was accuſed. The Page for all he was ſo young ſpake with a moſt profound ſubmiſſion, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not that he was guilty. He only ſaid, That having learnt by the publick report to what dreadful ſtraits his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Father was reduced, he was ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, that having nothing elſe but his Horſe, he had ſold him to give his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance, being reſolved to ſell himſelf alſo upon the ſame deſign, if he could find any body that would buy him. The Governour thought that the Page
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:53255:316"/> had undone himſelf, by too ingenuous a confeſſion, and that the Emperor was about to condemn him. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in that opinion, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Majeſty extraordinary penſive: But they were not thoughts of revenge that run in his mind. He admired the dutifulneſs and conſtancy of the Page; and as he had learnt from <hi>Chievres,</hi> that a Sovereign failed in the moſt indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable of his duties, when he let an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick action paſs without a reward, he caſt about how he might acknowledge this as it deſerved: But on the other hand, it had been done in a juncture wherein all that the Emperor could do to teſtifie the value he put upon it, would turn to his own prejudice. The Count of <hi>Salvatierra</hi> was the guiltieſt of all the Rebels: The Laws of <hi>Caſtille</hi> in that caſe prohibit his own Children to aſſiſt him: His Son nevertheleſs had done it; he confeſſed the ſame; and if a fault were crowned inſtead of puniſhed, the Emperor durſt not promiſe to himſelf the happineſs of peace in <hi>Spain,</hi> though he ſtood in extream need of it, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new affairs that the Empire was about to create unto him. It behoved then his Majeſty to find out an expedient, which on the one hand might hinder him
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:53255:317"/> from being unjuſt; and on the other, might ſo diſcreetly divert the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Juſtice, which he ſhould pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as they might not be prejudicial to the State, and in ſo nice a point he took this courſe. He ſeverely rebuked the Page before his Governour, yet preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afterward to pardon him in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration only of his youth. He ſent him back to his exerciſes; and bidding the Governour ſtay, commanded him to buy another Horſe for <hi>Ayala,</hi> as good at leaſt as that which he had ſold, under pretext that it would be an inhumane thing to turn him off at a time when his Fathers rebellion had reduced him to beggary; and if he kept him ſtill as a Page, it would be a ſhame if he were not as well mounted as the reſt of the Pages, ſeeing there was none of them deſcended of a better Family than he. The Emperor did no more ſo long as the Civil Wars of <hi>Spain</hi> laſted: But when they were over, he took occaſion of the firſt ſervice that <hi>Ayala</hi> when he was paſt being a Page rendred to <hi>Spain,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him both for it and for his affection towards his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand d' Avalos,</hi> though the moſt noted amongſt the Rebels, was not ſo ſtrictly ſearched after as the Count of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatierra,</hi>
               <pb n="609" facs="tcp:53255:317"/> whether becauſe he was not ſo guilty; or that the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> had reſpect to the great ſervices which the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> his near Kinſman, who carried the ſame name, Surname and Arms, had already rendred, and might ſtill render to the Crown. No notice was taken of him in the places where he had fled to: Several attempts that he made to get out of <hi>Spain</hi> were winked at, they let him go; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to know him when he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in diſguiſe, with a purpoſe to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France.</hi> He durſt not ſtay there, however after the breach betwixt <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt and the Emperor, for fear of rendring himſelf more guilty than he was; and retired into <hi>Germany,</hi> where being reduced to miſery, he was forced to try the friends that he had at the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court, if any pardon could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for him. He wrote to them all ſeverally, but moſt part refuſed to read his Letters; and the reſt who were not ſo ſcrupulous, did not think fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. So general an indifferency did not wholly diſcourage him yet. He had been a Courtier; and knew the humors of the men he had to do with; he was ſenſible that ſometime they beſtirred themſelves for diſgraced Criminals,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:53255:318"/> when they ſolicited them perſonally; but that they never concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the abſent. He thereupon formed a bold deſign of going to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Court, and uſed all neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection to conceal himſelf from thoſe to whom it was to no purpoſe he ſhould be known: But he had made too many friends to have none amongſt them unfaithful, in a place where friendſhip commonly is as unconſtant as favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D' Avalos</hi> diſcovered himſelf to a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> whom he took to be his friend, and indeed was not. The <hi>Caſtillian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations name him not, nor agree about his character. Some make him a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of State, and others give him only the title of a Courtier, which in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Tongue ſignifies no great matter when it ſtands alone. However it be, that man who had juſt before promiſed <hi>d' Avalos</hi> with execrable Oaths, that he would hazard all to get him a pardon, went immediately after to the Emperors Palace to work his ruine. He told his Majeſty that he had news of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to acquaint him with; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aſide, inſinuated that he was no leſs obliged to him than for his life. He added, that <hi>d' Avalos</hi> had had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to come to Court, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:53255:318"/> to run himſelf into a ſnare, that he could never get out of again: He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the place where he lay hid, gave directions how to find him without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſtaken, and to apprehend him without noiſe: He ſuppoſed that he was not come ſo near his Imperial Majeſty, but for putting in execution a Conſpiracy formed againſt him, whereof he was the Author or Accomplice; and omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might fortifie his conjecture.</p>
            <p>The Emperor heard him very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and having thanked him for the care he took for the preſervation of his perſon, diſmiſſed him. The news bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer returned home extraordinarily well ſatisfied with what he had done, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he had gained much by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing <hi>d' Avalos.</hi> He thought it not ſtrange that he was not rewarded upon the ſpot, becauſe he ſuppoſed that the Emperor thought it convenient firſt to apprehend the perſon who was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before he paid the Informer. In that thought he returned to Court at night, expecting that the firſt Courtier he met would whiſper him in the Ear that <hi>d' Avalos</hi> was taken: But he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſurpriſed when he heard nothing of it in the way, nor in the Emperors Antichamber. He caſt about a long
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:53255:319"/> time with himſelf what might be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, and could think of none other, but that his Majeſty had more urgent affairs. That ſatisfied him at firſt for the neglect that was put upon his advice: But when he found that it continued the ſecond and third day after, and that he learnt that <hi>d' Avalos</hi> ſolicited as before his pardon, from the place where he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded, he changed his opinion, and imagined that the Emperor had forgot what he had told him. He had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to put him in mind of it; and the Emperor not being able then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the treachery of the man, replied to him, <hi>You ought rather to go and tell</hi> d' Avalos <hi>that I am here, than to come and tell me again and again that he is there; becauſe in the preſent ſtate of affairs he had more reaſon to be afraid of me, than I of him.</hi> His Majeſty having ſaid ſo, made the Courtier a ſign with his hand to be gone, and <hi>d' Avalos</hi> was neither lookt after, nor put in priſon: It is true, he was excepted out of the Oblivion that was granted for the Rebellion of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was expeded in the manner of the Country which demanded it, that is to ſay, with exceptions that made it uſeleſs to the perſons of quality who ſtood in
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53255:319"/> need thereof. Two hundred were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in it by name and ſurname: But <hi>Chievres,</hi> who thought it not his part to oppoſe that oſtentation of ſeverity, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it almoſt wholly ineffectual by the way of execution, which he had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf for cluding it. He could not doubt but that the ſtorm which now was calmed, had chiefly been raiſed againſt him: He had ſeen the publick writings and private Satyrs that reviled him in ſo horrible a manner, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to read them without conceiving indignation againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: He was informed that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels had engaged themſelves by Oath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make peace with the Emperor, if he delivered not up to them that <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> who had been his Governour, and ſuffered them not to practiſe upon him and upon the Cardinal his Nephew, all that rage and malice could ſuggeſt to them: He underſtood the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour perfectly well, and knew that that people never part from a prejudice when once they have been poſſeſſed with it; and execute in ſecret the ſentences which they have pronounced, when there is no ſecurity for them to do it otherwiſe. Nevertheleſs he choſe rather to expoſe his perſon to continual Plots, than to
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:53255:320"/> permit the puniſhments which were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted for his ſafety.</p>
            <p>Of the two hundred that had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the Oblivion, there were but two puniſhed, and <hi>Chievres</hi> obtained pardon for the reſt. We ſhall ſee by and by, that that Heroick clemency much like to that of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was as unhappy as his; but the ſeries of affairs requires, that we firſt treat of one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices that <hi>Chievres</hi> rendred to the Emperor, which was the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Navarre</hi> to him. It hath been obſerved that the Clergy, Nobility and People of that Country were become all equally ſorry, that they had aſſiſted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to conquer their Country, and that they impatiently waited for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deliver themſelves from the yoke which they had put upon their own necks. That preſented as of it ſelf, and yet the moſt favourable that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> the Conſtable and Admiral of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in need of Troops to quell the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, thought it not enough to draw out of <hi>Navarre</hi> the greateſt part of thoſe that were in Gariſon there. They had alſo ordered the Artillery to be tranſported from thence into the Kingdoms of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> whether that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53255:320"/> neceſſary for them to batter down the Rebellion; or that deſpairing to preſerve <hi>Navarre</hi> during the Civil War, they reſolved at leaſt to make the beſt of the Cannon that were there. The thing was fully put in execution; and the <hi>Navarreſe</hi> wanting only an Army to ſecond them in the defection which they were hatching, demanded one of the Counteſs of <hi>Chateanbrian,</hi> who at that time could do any thing in <hi>France.</hi> They repreſented to her that their Crown ſprang from her houſe, and muſt return to it again: That her three brothers, <hi>Lautrec, Aſparaut,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Foix,</hi> were the next Heirs to <hi>Henry d' Albert:</hi> That that Prince not being as yet of Age to carry Arms, had need that his Couſin-german ſhould act for him: That the recovery then in agitation was neither doubtful nor difficult, that all that was neceſſary to be done was only to take a Frontier place, and then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the heart of the Country, where they would be favourably received: That on the one hand they would have the hearts of the people, and on the other, no Enemy in the Field.</p>
            <p>Two of the Brothers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs were employed. <hi>Lautrec</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:53255:321"/> the Mareſchal <hi>de Foix</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Cavalry there. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the Letters of the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> de Foix <hi>to the King.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Aſparaut</hi> only remained, who having no leſs courage nor ambition than they, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at home for want of an employment that he judged worthy of himſelf. The recovery of <hi>Navarre</hi> was the moſt ſignal opportunity of getting reputation that for ſome years had been offered. Glory there was enough to be acquired in caſe it ſucceeded, and no great honour to be loſt if it ſucceeded not. So that the Counteſs employed her intereſt with <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, to engage him in the War of <hi>Navarre.</hi> She told him, that it was his intereſt to do it, and that he might do ſo without breaking with the Emperor: That there was neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor Forces demanded from him, but that he would only ſuffer under hand men to be raiſed in the Provinces lying betwixt the <hi>Loire</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees:</hi> That if the enterpriſe proved unfortunate, it would ſuffice for his excuſe to diſown it; and if ſucceſsful, his Majeſty might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate in Council, whether he ſhould recal <hi>Aſparaut,</hi> or aſſiſt him to purſue his Conqueſts in <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end <hi>France</hi> might in a Treaty of Peace exchange them with the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="617" facs="tcp:53255:321"/>
            <p>The King had no more meaſures to be obſerved with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had refuſed to ſet on foot again the Negotiation of <hi>Montpellier.</hi> His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had too publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would by all means have the houſe of <hi>Albert</hi> reſtored to the Throne of <hi>Navarre</hi> to neglect ſo favourable an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that offered of it ſelf; and now the time was come when the two greateſt Monarchs of <hi>Europe</hi> were to begin a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that was to out-laſt themſelves, and expoſe <hi>Hungary</hi> to the invaſion of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> thought it not enough to ſuffer the Families of <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Foix</hi> do as they thought beſt in <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> where both had vaſt Eſtates; but favoured them in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret as much as they could; and the young Gentlemen of <hi>Gaſconny</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they would pleaſe their King by liſting themſelves under <hi>Aſparaut,</hi> flocked to his Colours in great numbers. The Army was on foot before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror knew that it was a levying; and the Hiſtorians, who agree that it was made up of choice men, do ſo vary about the number of the Soldiers, that it is not poſſible to reconcile them. Some reckon them only to have been Eight thouſand;
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:53255:322"/> but others again ſwell them up to thirty. It is alſo more difficult to be decided, whether or not there was any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence betwixt <hi>Aſparaut</hi> and the Rebels of <hi>Spain;</hi> for the Authors on the other ſide of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> poſitively aſſert it, and prove it by fragments of ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which they ſay were found in <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut</hi>'s Cabinet. The <hi>French</hi> writers formally maintain the contrary: And certainly there is nothing of it, neither amongſt the Records of the houſe of <hi>Foix,</hi> nor amongſt the Papers of <hi>Robertet,</hi> who at that time diſcharged alone the office of Secretary of State under <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>However it be, the enterprize of <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut</hi> was well enough conducted in the beginning. He made the beſt of the fault of the Mareſchal of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which was mentioned in the foregoing Book, and thought it not fit to engage himſelf in the mountains as he had done, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him the important place of <hi>S. John-Pie-de Port.</hi> He beſieged it in the uſual form; and ſeeing nothing withſtands the firſt impetuoſity of the <hi>French,</hi> the beſieged at the end of five or ſix days ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated, though they had all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for maintaining a longer ſiege. <hi>Aſparaut,</hi> who would loſe no time, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:53255:322"/> over the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> by the memorable paſſage of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> and at his deſcent was joyned by all that remained in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> of the Faction of <hi>Grammont</hi> able to carry Arms. The Duke of <hi>Najara,</hi> Viceroy for the Emperor, had none of thoſe qualities that ſerve to help men at a dead lift, when they are left in the lurch by other peoples fault. He was ſuperfluouſly cautious in all manner of affairs, and ventured nothing but what he was forced to hazard, as he ſaid, to the diſcretion of fortune. He would not accept the Vice-royalty of <hi>Navarre,</hi> till they aſſured him that he ſhould want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was neceſſary for making a good defence, in caſe he were attacked: Nevertheleſs they had taken from him moſt part of his Artillery and Troops to be employed againſt the Rebels. He was ſo concerned at that, that at the ſame time he deſired to be diſcharged of his Government; but it was not in their thoughts to remove from <hi>Navarre</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> who poſſeſſed ſo fair an Eſtate upon the Frontiers of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as might afford him means of preſerving it during the Civil War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres,</hi> by order of the Emperor, had written to him oftner than once, that his Majeſty entreated him to continue his
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:53255:323"/> care in the Vice-royalty that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; aſſuring him that he ſhould not be attacked: That the Spies whom he entertained in <hi>France</hi> had ſent him word, that the Levies which were making there, were only to recruit the Army of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> that guarded the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Milan;</hi> and if they might have contrary deſigns, the Troops of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Guypuſcoa</hi> ſhould without fail be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to march into <hi>Navarre.</hi> The Duke obeyed in the opinion that the Emperors Council was ſo well informed of what was in agitation out of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they could not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the meaſures that they took for preſerving it, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres.</note> but he found himſelf to be miſtaken, when he was informed of the ſiege of <hi>S. John-Pie-de Port.</hi> He ſtayed nevertheleſs in <hi>Pampelona</hi> after that he knew the place was ſurrendred, becauſe he imagined that the Forces which he had ſent to guard the paſſage of <hi>Ronce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux</hi> being re-inforced by the Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, would beat back the <hi>French;</hi> or at leaſt would ſtop them ſo long, till the Troops of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Guypuſcoa</hi> ſhould have time to come into <hi>Navarre;</hi> but he was as far out in his own ſuppoſition, as he was in the conjectures of others. The
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:53255:323"/> Mountaneers, who bragg'd that they alone had defeated the Rear of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi> not only refuſed to aſſiſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in the defence of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> but alſo offered to <hi>Aſparaut</hi> to charge them in the Rear at the ſame time that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them in the Front. They ſent him word of this by ſeveral hands, one of which being ſurpriſed by the Viceroys Scouts, juſt as he was about to enter the <hi>French</hi> Camp, confeſſed the truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, who preſumed not ſo much upon their own ſtrength, as to be able alone to guard the paſſage, though they had had only to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Front, abandoned it before they were beſet; and retreated with ſo much haſte, that the Duke had the firſt news of their retreat from themſelves. Upon ſeeing of them, he loſt all hopes of ſaving <hi>Navarre;</hi> yet before he would imitate their example, he thought fit to try the Inhabitants of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> whether they were more affectioned to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than the Mountaneers were. He employed Agents to ſpeak to them, who brought him back word, that they could not be worſe affected than they were towards the Emperor, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they had reaſon for it too afflicting to be diſſembled. All the Forts that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:53255:324"/> the Town, and might ſerve it for a Rampart, had by order been demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for the building of a Citadel, which was almoſt finiſhed. If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants delayed longer to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, they would loſe their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if on the contrary they declared for <hi>Aſparaut,</hi> they were aſſured that the firſt favour that he would grant them, would be to raze the Citadel that annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
            <p>So that the anſwer of thoſe of <hi>Pampelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was very ambiguous; and the Duke not finding it to be ſuch as he deſired, laid the blame upon the Emiſſaries. He had a better opinion of his own ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than of theirs; and imagined that if he himſelf made a ſpeech to the Burghers, he would perſwade them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the laſt: He aſſembled them in the Market-place, and made a very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſcourſe to them, to perſwade them that <hi>Aſparaut</hi> was a raw General, and his whole Army made up of Voluntiers: That there needed no more to overcome them, but to baulk their firſt furious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; and that as it was not poſſible to do it in <hi>Navarre</hi> out of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> ſo there was nothing more eaſie than to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it within ſo vaſt a City: That the ſucceſs depended abſolutely on the firſt
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:53255:324"/> aſſault; and that if the <hi>French</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, they would return back again as faſt as they came: That the truth was, it required Force to guard the breach that was made for the building of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel; but that if the Inhabitants would undertake to defend the reſt of their walls, the Soldiers that upon ſurrender marched out of <hi>S. John Pie-de Port,</hi> and thoſe who returned from <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> were more than enough to maintain the Avenues by which the City had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Citadel.</p>
            <p>The Duke had no ſooner made an end of his ſpeech, but that the Magiſtrate being already convinced that there was no more to be feared on the part of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> anſwered with a blunt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, that he agreed as to the way how the firſt impetuoſity of the <hi>French</hi> was to be baulked, but that he perceived no means to do it; and that if the Duke knew any, he would do him a kindneſs to tell him: That the queſtion was not only how to beat off the attack of the <hi>French;</hi> but alſo to withſtand thoſe of the Citizens whom they had gained, who would infallibly declare for them in the heat of the Fight: That <hi>Pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> ſo divided, was not in a condition to hold out againſt an Army, which a place
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:53255:325"/> regularly fortified at the foot of the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> themſelves were not able to put a ſtop to; and that as the capital City of <hi>Navarre,</hi> though there was no breach in the walls, had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding opened the Gates to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> when they were ſtrongeſt, upon no other motive, but to avoid being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; ſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought not to take it ill if it changed Maſter now they had reduced it to an impoſſibility of making a defence, by laying it open in the very place where before it was ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>The Duke heard that Language with indignation: But paſſion is always ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous in thoſe who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to lay a conſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the relation of the ſecond taking of</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona.</note> that they may not follow the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which it ſuggeſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The Duke was not the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Pampelona,</hi> though he had Forces there; and if he had replied briskly to the Magiſtrate, it would have occaſioned a ſedition of a doubtful iſſue. If the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had been the ſtronger, they would have continued irreconcileable with the Citizens, without whoſe aſſiſtance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they could not have been able to defend themſelves againſt <hi>Aſparaut;</hi> and if they had been the weaker, the
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:53255:325"/> Duke would have been made priſoner by the Citizens, who would have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them up to the <hi>French,</hi> to make their peace again with them. The courſe he took in this perplexity, was to leave the Citizens of <hi>Pampelona</hi> to their fidelity; to draw out the Soldiers, who were not abſolutely neceſſary for the guard of the Citadel; to ſend them to the Town of <hi>Eſteille,</hi> which he thought more affectionate to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and to take Poſt to <hi>Segovia,</hi> where the Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> was, to give him an account of his conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſparaut</hi> in the mean time advanced towards <hi>Pampelona,</hi> where the Citizens being forſaken by their Viceroy, ſent Deputies to him, and offered to ſubmit, provided they had an Act of Oblivion granted them in good form. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed their former defection, in that <hi>John d' Albert</hi> when he left them, had allowed them liberty, as they underſtood it, to diſpoſe of their City, and joyfully ſubmitted to <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> his Son. So <hi>Aſparaut</hi> had no more to do but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench himſelf before the Citadel, and having ſummoned the Gariſon who proteſted that they would bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under its ruines, furiouſly to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: But the obſtinacy of the Gariſon
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:53255:326"/> laſted not above three days; and it was during that ſiege that <hi>S. Ignatius Loyala,</hi> the famous Founder of the Society of the Jeſuits, who ſerved in the place as a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier, received the wound which put into his mind the firſt thoughts of forſaking the world. The Governour of the Citadel perceiving a conſiderable breach made, and his beſt Soldiers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from fighting, capitulated, and <hi>Aſparaut</hi> left about two thouſand men to guard the place, and repair the breaches. He made haſte with the reſt of his Army to march ſtreight to the Town of <hi>Eſteille,</hi> his good fortune attending him. Thoſe whom the Duke of <hi>Najara</hi> left there had not the courage to defend it; but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred it upon the firſt ſummons.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Navarre</hi> recovered for the houſe of <hi>Albert,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> one thouſand five hundred and twenty one, with as much eaſe as it was loſt nine years before; and <hi>Aſparaut</hi> had been the moſt fortunate ſubject of his time, if he had known how to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when he had executed his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and gone no farther: But young men are not to be entruſted with the command of Armies, when there is no more to be put to the hazard. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Aſparaut</hi> after the conqueſt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
               <pb n="627" facs="tcp:53255:326"/> was ſtronger than before; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he had not loſt many Soldiers before the places which he had beſieged, all the <hi>Navarreſe</hi> of the Faction of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> had met to conſult what conduct to follow as to him. They reſolved that part of them ſhould go and joyn him, and that the reſt ſhould ſtay till <hi>Aſparaut</hi> ſent for them. The inequality of his conduct, to ſpeak properly, was the cauſe of his ruine, and it is in vain for Hiſtorians to have ſearched elſewhere the cauſes of the misfortunes that over whelmed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſparaut</hi> knew that <hi>Navarre</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear from abroad, ſo long as it was not divided at home; and that all the miſunderſtanding which had ariſen there, was betwixt the Factions of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Beaumont.</hi> In the mean time they had been reconciled in his preſence, and the agreement was made in ſuch a manner, that it ſeemed nothing could alter it for the future. Both the one and other had learnt by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it was their diſcord which had ſubjected them to the <hi>Caſtillians;</hi> and ſeeing they hated the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> more than they did mutually one another, there was no appearance, that their quarrels would revive again; ſince they were convinced that they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:53255:327"/> them but to the prejudice of their Country. So that there being no more cauſe of fear within <hi>Navarre, Aſparaut</hi> turned his thoughts abroad; and was of opinion, that for obtaining from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror a Peace wherein he ſhould abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce his pretenſions to <hi>Navarre,</hi> there was a neceſſity of taking an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant place in <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and of keeping it ſo long as the War laſted. He propoſed this to <hi>Arnauld de Grammont,</hi> who under him commanded the Cavalry of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and whom he eſteemed more than the other Officers of his Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grammont,</hi> who was of a piercing wit, ſaw at firſt the fault that his General was about to commit, and endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from it. He repreſented to him, that the courſe he intended to take for obtaining an advantageous Peace; would be good betwixt two Enemies, whoſe Forces were near equal; and who by conſequent might not only have their intereſt, but alſo their reputation to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: But that the caſe was not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Emperor and <hi>Henry d' Albert,</hi> ſeeing he the Son of a Father and Mother almoſt ſtript of all, had no other reſource but the Army which he had then on foot: That an extraordinary occaſion had offered it ſelf for the recovery of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
               <pb n="629" facs="tcp:53255:327"/> which was the Civil War amongſt the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That he had made uſe of it, and was therein more ſucceſsful than he expected to have been. But that however he had but performed one half of what he intended: That it was not enough for him to be reſtored to the Throne of his Predeceſſors; but that he muſt alſo maintain himſelf in it, which could not be without much prudence and time, eſpecially when he had to do with an Enemy infinitely more powerful than himſelf: That the truth was, the victorious Army was ſtrong enough to maintain the new Conqueſt, provided it continued in the condition it was in, and went not out of <hi>Navarre,</hi> where the people refuſed not the Soldiers free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But if it entred <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and were weakned by a ſiege, it could no longer keep the Field; and the charges of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it being then double, the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varreſe</hi> would infallibly refuſe to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereto: That in fine, to maintain himſelf in <hi>Navarre,</hi> he ought to imitate the conduct of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that as the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> when he took that Crown from <hi>John d' Albert,</hi> purſued not his victory into the principality of <hi>Bearn,</hi> though it would not have been difficult for him to have
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:53255:328"/> ſeized that dependance of <hi>Navarre;</hi> ſo <hi>Aſparaut</hi> ought to content himſelf with the Kingdom which now he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and to advance no farther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſparaut</hi> found not <hi>Grammont</hi>'s reaſons to his liking. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had not made ſufficient reſiſtance in <hi>Navarre,</hi> to give him occaſion of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much glory as he deſired; and he thought that ſtopping ſhort in ſo fair a cariere, he might deſerve the character of a fortunate, but not of an excellent Captain. Beſides, he was the younger Brother of a Family where there was not Eſtate enough for the younger: His birth and profeſſion hindred him from acquiring a fortune any other way, but by the Sword; an extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſented; and if he loſt it, ſeeing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he had done nothing for himſelf, he was in danger of doing nothing as long as he lived. He had indeed taken a great deal of pains, but that was for <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> his Couſin, who could reward him but meanly, and out of the Eſtate which he poſſeſſed in <hi>France;</hi> the Lands of <hi>Navarre</hi> not being of a nature to be held by ſtrangers: Whereas if he advanced his conqueſts into <hi>Caſtille,</hi> he would at leaſt retain them until the Peace; and in the mean time raiſe vaſt
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:53255:328"/> contributions from them, which might render him the richeſt Subject in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſelfiſh conſiderations of <hi>Aſparaut</hi> were backt by the clamours of the young Officers of his Army, who importuned him that he would be as good as his word to them, when they were enrolled, which was to let them have a bruſh with the Enemy. They added, that he had not ſo much as ſhew'd them the <hi>Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that they were come into, and had recovered <hi>Navarre</hi> without a view of them. That if they ſtopt there, they would leave no marks of their valour to poſterity: Whereas by entring into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,</hi> if they found the people ſtill in Rebellion there, they would ſubdue them without trouble; and if they found them again reduced under obedience to the Emperor, they would ſtill come to as good a Market, ſince the two parties would be ſo weakened by fighting one againſt another, that hardly could they make any reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The moſt dangerous Counſels are moſt commonly followed in Armies, where young men have the chief Authority, <hi>Aſparaut</hi>'s Army was ſubject to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and it was reſolved there that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould march out of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre:</hi>
               <pb n="632" facs="tcp:53255:329"/> That they ſhould paſs the River <hi>Ebre,</hi> which ſeparates that Kingdom from <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That they ſhould lay ſiege to the Town of <hi>Logrogno;</hi> and that having taken it, they ſhould extend their conqueſts farther. The deſign was raſh: Nevertheleſs the moſt expert in the Art confeſſed ſince, that it would have ſucceeded, if it had been as haſtily put in execution as it was formed. The Town of <hi>Logrogno,</hi> though the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> lookt upon it as a key of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> had been ungariſoned as well as the Towns of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and not ſo much as a Soldier left therein. They had alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Ammunition out of it, and left there only the Proviſions. For at leaſt half an Age the Inhabitants had had no neceſſity of carrying Arms; and that long reſt joynedto the fertility of their Country, entertained them in a ſoftneſs that would have obliged them to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the firſt ſummons, if it had been made when there was no body to help them to defend the place. But <hi>Aſparaut</hi> by a ſecond fault leſs to be repaired than the former, made a ſtop three whole days to refreſh his Army in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the little Town of <hi>Arcos;</hi> and thereby gave time to the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had continued loyal to the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:53255:329"/> Emperor, to provide for the ſecurity of <hi>Logrogno.</hi> They put into it <hi>Pedro Velez Guevera,</hi> a prudent and expert Captain, with a ſtrong Gariſon, who at firſt made himſelf abſolute Maſter of the place: He turned out of it all uſeleſs mouths, and cauſed them to be conducted farther in into <hi>Caſtille,</hi> to places where they might be maintained at publick coſt. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the nick of time the Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſtood in need of, the Gentlemen of the Country having provided it at their own charges; and the Governour thought it not enough to diſpute every inch of ground with the Beſiegers, he beſides drowned all the Fields about <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogno</hi> by means of the Banks of the <hi>Ebre,</hi> which he cauſed to be cut; and ſo much the more confounded the <hi>French,</hi> that at that time they were not skilful enough in that part of Mathematicks which teaches Beſiegers how to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt waters. <hi>Aſparaut,</hi> though he found upon his arrival matters in this ſtate, yet for all that undertook the ſiege, and vigorouſly proſecuted the ſame: But beſides the prodigious reſiſtance he met with, there happened an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had not foreſeen. The Civil War ceaſed ſo ſuddenly in <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Villalar,</hi>
               <pb n="634" facs="tcp:53255:330"/> that the three Governours had time to ſend their own and the Rebels Army, of which the Rear had only fought, to the relief of <hi>Logrogno;</hi> and the Emperor was informed, that that important place was beſieged, at the ſame time when he had notice that an Army was marching to the relief of it.</p>
            <p>He communicated the news of both to <hi>Chievres,</hi> who was diſſatisfied with <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt, ever ſince his moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Majeſty had refuſed to approve the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which Queen <hi>Germana</hi> had made to him of the Inheritance of <hi>Foix;</hi> and probably in that heat of reſentment, <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> counſelled the Emperor to make uſe of the imprudence of <hi>Aſperaut,</hi> in ſuch a manner as would infallibly gain <hi>Spain</hi> the advantage over <hi>France.</hi> The Letters which the Emperor had received from the three Governours contained a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which they had inſerted without any deſign. And it was this that when <hi>Aſparaut</hi> firſt approached to <hi>Logrogno,</hi> a pair of Colours had been diſcovered in his Army with this Inſcription, <hi>To the glory of the King of</hi> France <hi>and the Lilies.</hi> If the thing was true, and if the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> invented it not, as the <hi>French</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſince, the Colours muſt have been made by ſome capricious Captain of Foot,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:53255:330"/> without the knowledge of his General; ſince it is certain, and the writers of both Nations agree, that <hi>Aſparaut</hi> when he entred <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Caſtille,</hi> declared himſelf to be General of the Army of <hi>Henry d' Albert,</hi> and not of the Army of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and that he executed the orders of the former of thoſe two Kings, and not of the latter: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Chievres</hi> took occaſion from it to repreſent to his Maſter, that that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular well managed, would be enough to engage <hi>England</hi> in his intereſts.</p>
            <p>He put his Imperial Majeſty in mind, that in the laſt conference which he had had with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Uncle, where he had the honour to be preſent, his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> had let fall a word, that if the War broke out again, betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> he would declare for that Monarchy of the two, which ſhould be firſt attacked. That though the word perhaps drop'd from him as in courſe, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, yet he ought to make his beſt of it, and ſend an extraordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador into <hi>England</hi> to demand the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, and to exaggerate the ambition of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> whilſt the Imperial Agents ſhould every where give it out, that the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:53255:331"/> 
               <hi>French</hi> had not very long made uſe of the pretext of <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> for entring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilely into <hi>Spain,</hi> and for favouring the Rebellion of the Emperors Subjects: That they had taken off the Vizor when they paſſed the River of <hi>Ebre,</hi> and had retaken the <hi>Flowers de Lice</hi> upon their entry into <hi>Caſtille:</hi> That under their own Colours they beſieged the Town of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogno;</hi> and that ſo the juncture was come, wherein the King of <hi>England</hi> had promiſed to declare himſelf: That <hi>Spain</hi> was conſtantly attacked, and that it challenged the promiſe of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor, who run no risk in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the counſel of <hi>Chievres,</hi> ſent the Count of <hi>Raeux</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> with inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drawn according to the reaſons which we have now abridged. The Count, who was never before employed in any Negotiation, ſucceeded in this, which was his firſt Eſſay; but not altogether, becauſe of his ability, though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> made no ſuch account of the word, which, as was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto him, he had paſt, as to think himſelf obliged to keep it, but he ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelf other conſiderations, which were not in the Counts inſtructions. He examined which of the two, <hi>France</hi> or
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:53255:331"/> 
               <hi>Spain,</hi> he had moſt reaſon to be afraid of as affairs then ſtood; and he found it to be <hi>France;</hi> for though the Emperor was raiſed to a prodigious power, and that there was none in the world comparable to it in extent, yet it was not ſuſpicious to <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing the Emperor could not attack it by Land before he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all <hi>France,</hi> which could never be in the opinion of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and as to the Sea, <hi>England</hi> would be always ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Spain:</hi> Whereas if the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy having re-eſtabliſhed its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Italy</hi> by the recovery of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſhould enlarge it ſelf beyond the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> by conquering there the Country of the beſt Soldiers, which lay along the River of <hi>Ebre;</hi> it would not only not own the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Arbitrator of the differences, which it had with the Emperor, but alſo might very well take the advantage of the firſt favourable occaſion that ſhould preſent and confine the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their own Iſland, by taking from them what they ſtill retained in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth concluded from that principle, that it was his intereſt by all means to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king footing upon the Banks of the <hi>Ebre,</hi> and upon that ſole conſideration ſigned a
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:53255:332"/> League Defenſive and Offenſive with the Emperor againſt the moſt Chriſtian King; which he would not have done as he many times declared afterward, if <hi>Aſparaut</hi> had ſtopt in <hi>Navarre;</hi> or that if he would have continued his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, he had only carried them on along the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> without advancing at firſt into the very heart of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before a fortnight was over, the King of <hi>England</hi> found that his fear was vain, and repented that he had declared ſo ſoon, but the Count of <hi>Raeux</hi> having obtained what he deſired, was already gone from his Court, when the news was brought to <hi>England</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> were driven out of <hi>Caſtille.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having joyned the Rebellious Troops, as they called them, to thoſe whom they named Obedient, made an Army of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; and marched in good order to the relief of <hi>Logrogno</hi> at the time when the number of the Beſiegers was ſo dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that it was no longer ſufficient for guarding all the Avenues to the place. The Enemy perceived it, and took ſuch good meaſures, that they put into it four thouſand Foot. Having done ſo, with the reſt of their Forces they cut off the Beſiegers Proviſions, and forced them to raiſe the ſiege, after they had made many
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:53255:332"/> unſucceſsful aſſaults. <hi>Aſparaut</hi> repaſſed the <hi>Ebre,</hi> and retreated in all haſte to put himſelf under the cover of the Guns of <hi>Pampelona;</hi> there being no Town nearer where he could lie ſafely; and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had almoſt ſuffered him to do it. There happened amongſt them upon their coming into <hi>Logrogno</hi> a debate which would have hindred them from recovering <hi>Navarre,</hi> had it not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon ended as begun. Their chief Officers agreed eaſily in a Council of War, that the <hi>French</hi> muſt be cloſe purſued in the Rear; but at firſt they could not agree about the choice of him, who ſhould be their head after that they had paſſed the <hi>Ebre.</hi> The Count of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> who till then had commanded them, pretended ſtill to the command; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for his reaſon, that he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared General againſt the <hi>French,</hi> his Commiſſion could not expire till he had defeated them, or ſent them beyond the <hi>Pyrenees:</hi> He added, that that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was indeed no more but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory of that which <hi>Chievres</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him to purſue the Rebels by Arms, and to reſettle <hi>Spain</hi> in its former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: He maintained that the <hi>French</hi> had firſt entred <hi>Navarre,</hi> and then <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille</hi> through intelligence with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:53255:333"/> and from thence concluded, that his command could not be taken from him without injuſtice, until <hi>Navarre</hi> ſhould be recovered, or that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had given other orders.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Najara,</hi> on the contrary, ſaid that he was actually Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and that the Letters Patents which he had for it from the Emperor, were not recalled: That it was expreſly mentioned in them that he ſhould be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all the Forces that acted in that Kingdom for his Imperial Majeſty, for what cauſe, and upon what occaſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould be brought together; and that there was no limitation made in that particular: That the revolution which had ſince happened in <hi>Navarre,</hi> could do no prejudice to his power; and that in true policy it ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but in the ſence that Lawyers look upon Torrents, which though for ſome time they overflow the Lands of private men, yet do not deprive them of their poſſeſſion, nor ſo much as interrupt it when once it hath been lawfully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Haro</hi> had no ground to queſtion the Letters Patents of the Duke of <hi>Najara,</hi> but he alledged that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereby conferred had expired by the
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:53255:333"/> Dukes fault: That he had abandoned his Vice-royalty upon the approach of the Enemy; and that he had ſo abſolutely loſt it, that there was not ſo much as one Village in all <hi>Navarre</hi> where his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was owned: That that Kingdom having wholly changed its Maſter, the buſineſs was to conquer it of new; and by conſequence to take ſuch meaſures as no more concerned the Duke, than as he had never been Viceroy. The reaſon and inclination of thoſe who gave their Votes, ſeemed to give the cauſe to the Count: Nevertheleſs he loſt it, and the Duke was preferred before him by an effect of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> prudence, which hath hardly ever failed in the ſignal occaſions of ſacrificing juſtice to intereſt, when the good of the Monarchy was thought to be concerned. The Army which had relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Logrogno,</hi> and earneſtly deſired to recover <hi>Navarre,</hi> was ſo wholly made up of Voluntiers, that there was not ſo much as one Company of Foot, or Troop of Horſe that had any pay from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The Duke of <hi>Najara</hi> was the Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had brought moſt Soldiers to the Camp; and it was to be feared that theſe Soldiers, who only came upon his account, would return back with him if he withdrew, as he muſt be
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:53255:334"/> obliged to do in honour, if he obtained not the General command. His Son had gathered together five or ſix thouſand men from the Provinces bordering upon the Mountains, and <hi>Don Gaſpar de Butron</hi> his Son-in-law had raiſed almoſt as many more in the Provinces of <hi>Guypuſcoa</hi> and <hi>Biſcay.</hi> Theſe were the choice men of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army; and ſo great a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have ſo weakened it, that it could not have been able to have purſued <hi>Aſparaut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Admiral of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> foreſaw that inconvenient, and by conſequence made no ſcruple to diſcontent <hi>Haro,</hi> notwithſtanding they were chiefly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for the taking of <hi>Tordeſillas,</hi> and the victory of <hi>Villavar.</hi> They gave their Vote openly in favour of the Duke; and the Count, who was ſtill very much diſpleaſed with them, though he would have done the ſame as they did, had he been in their place, left the Army in ſpight, and went home to his own houſe.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Duke had taken upon him the Command, he omitted nothing that might render him worthy of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they had done him. He purſued the <hi>French</hi> with ſo great diligence, that he never failed to dine in the ſame places
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:53255:334"/> where they had lain. He haraſſed them in their march by continual skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and at length came up with them near the Foreſt of <hi>Roniego,</hi> when they were but two Leagues from <hi>Pampelona.</hi> The relations which agree very well in what we have ſaid, do ſo vary about this ſubject, that it is not poſſible poſitively to relate the matter of fact. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> maintain that their Camp was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> and the City of <hi>Pampelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> That being ſo Encamped, they took from them all communication with that capital City of <hi>Navarre,</hi> where never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs all ſorts of Proviſions were: That ſo though they were moſt advantageouſly poſted, they wanted Bread, and that that was the only thing that made them hazard a Battel. But there is an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made againſt that which cannot be anſwered. It is taken from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Aſparaut</hi> immediately after his defeat, which we are about to relate, wrote to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; and common ſence is ſufficient to judge, that if he had been forced to fight, and the matter of fact aſſerted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been true, that General might have had his excuſe ready, by alledging that he was forced to give Battel, and his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty could have had nothing elſe
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:53255:335"/> to impute to him, but his misfortune. In the mean time he not only not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons any conſtraint to have been put upon him, but more, he writes poſitively the contrary. He agrees that he had liberty either to fight or not to fight as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: He affirms that the only motive which enclined him to give Battel, was the diſorder that he ſaw in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, which he thought he ought to lay hold on: But he adds, that the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was too quickly over; and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he had not been beaten, if his Foot had ſeconded the efforts of his Horſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> relations, then, more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affirm, that <hi>Aſparaut</hi>'s communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the City of <hi>Pampelona</hi> was not intercepted: That the truth was, he had not as yet got any Proviſions out of it, but that nothing hindred him from it: That he was Encamped in ſuch a place as it was impoſſible to ſtarve, force, or oblige him to fight whether he would or not; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſpaired of it when they had well conſidered his poſt: That they had brought no proviſions with them; and that the Low-Country of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ravaged upon their retreat, having nothing to ſupply their Enemies with, <hi>Aſparaut</hi> needed to have done no more,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:53255:335"/> but to have lain ſtill at <hi>Roniego,</hi> and ſeen the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army diſperſed in a few days, being neither in a condition to Aſſault nor Beſiege the City of <hi>Pampelona;</hi> and that by that means he had infallibly ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> the conqueſt of <hi>Navarre.</hi> But that he committed a fault no more to be excuſed than repaired, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hazarded a Battel without taking three meaſures ſo eaſie for winning of it, that he had them almoſt in his hands. The firſt was not to have drawn out the two thouſand Soldiers whom he had left in <hi>Pampelona;</hi> and who might have ſalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in time of Battel with ſo much leſs danger; that the Citizens who were more concerned than they that <hi>Aſparant</hi> ſhould have gained it, would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented that they ſhould have joyned their General, and in the mean time taken upon themſelves the defence of the walls. The ſecond, that <hi>Aſparant</hi> recalled not the Forces which he left to guard the Frontiers of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> whilſt he was to have acted in <hi>Caſtille.</hi> The Lord of <hi>Olla</hi> who commanded them, wrote of it to his General, and they could do no ſervice where they were, ſince the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had recalled theirs out of <hi>Biſcay</hi> for reinforcing their Army. They had been in no action, but at the Siege of S. <hi>John-
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:53255:336"/> Pie de Port,</hi> and had ever ſince been in quarters of refreſhment. Their number which is not exactly known, and their experience which is not diſputed, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very well that they ſhould have been expected for giving a deciſive Battel; and both parties agreed, that if they had been there, they would have infallibly inclined the advantage to the ſide of the <hi>French.</hi> In fine, <hi>Aſparaut</hi>'s third fault was, that he ſtaid not for ſix thouſand <hi>Navarreſe,</hi> who were to joyn him that very day, or at fartheſt the day following. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had raiſed them upon their own charges, and all their Officers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Soldiers: There was not one of them but would have died fighting, rather than have yielded a foot of ground; becauſe all of them lookt upon it as the greateſt of misfortunes, to fall again under the dominion of the <hi>Caſtillians.</hi> If <hi>Aſparaut</hi> had not truſted them ſo much as to have taken them into his Army, they might at leaſt have made a Body of reſerve; and in that manner ſupplied the defect, which according to all writers made the <hi>French</hi> loſe the Battel, their Infantry having been only worſted, becauſe there were no freſh Forces ready to aſſiſt them at a pinch: And the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Body of reſerve, who took their time to fall upon them
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:53255:336"/> when they ſaw them tired, and without ſupport, having had a cheap bargain on't.</p>
            <p>However it be, there was nothing to be found fault with in the drawing up of the <hi>French</hi> Army, nor in the briskneſs of their firſt charge, though they were in number inferior to the Enemy by one half. Nothing was able to reſiſt the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of their right Wing; and the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> who commanded the left Wing of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> made head againſt them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. His Squadrons were opened, and his Batallions broken: His Horſe threw him, and fell upon him; and if he had not been remounted by his Servants, he muſt have been trodden to death by his Horſes. But that diſorder was preſently rectified; and the Admiral of <hi>Caſtille</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with five thouſand Horſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the left Wing, took his time to charge <hi>Grammont,</hi> when the Squadrons of that Lieutenant General of <hi>Aſparaut</hi>'s were diſordered by the great effort they had made, and cut his way through them. <hi>Aſparaut</hi> in the main Body ſeeing him in ſuch extremity, advanced to cover him, till he ſhould put himſelf into order again; and with much reſolution reſiſted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Admiral of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Najara</hi> alſo, whom he had to deal with,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:53255:337"/> and the whole main Body of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The left Wing of the <hi>French</hi> led by <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> with no leſs courage, charged the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Right, commanded by the Count of <hi>Benevento,</hi> and put them alſo to the rout. They did not offer to purſue them; but were marching ſtreight to <hi>Aſparaut</hi>'s main Body to compleat their victory, by diſingaging their General from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was in, when they were diverted by the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtille</hi> at the head of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> reſerve, who charged them in the Flank and opened them. <hi>Mauleon</hi>'s Horſe, who had neither been killed nor diſmounted, wheeled about to rally again behind the Foot, and to prepare for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond charge; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> right Wing gave them not the time. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon beaten as charged; and the Conſtable having no more to be afraid of on that ſide, endeavoured to cut in pieces a Batallion of a thouſand old <hi>Gaſcon</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who guarded the <hi>French</hi> Artillery. He ſucceeded in it more eaſily than he had expected; and turning the ten Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces which he had gained, againſt <hi>Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut,</hi> made a dreadful havock in the main Body of the <hi>French</hi> Army. He broke into it by that means, and made himſelf ſure of an intire victory.</p>
            <p>One of his Cavaliers, called <hi>Perrea,</hi>
               <pb n="649" facs="tcp:53255:337"/> engaged ſingly him who carried the white Standard of the <hi>French;</hi> overthrew him, took the Standard, and carried it to his General, who afterward obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Emperour for him to change his Eſcutcheon. <hi>Aſparaut</hi> having loſt all the brave men that were about him, was environed by the Squadron of the Count of <hi>Alva de Liſte,</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound by a Sword, which blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he was diſmounted. He rendred himſelf priſoner to <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who had ten thouſand Crowns for his Ranſom. The Victorious having left five or ſix thouſand dead in the field of Battel, purſued the Fugitives to <hi>Pampelona,</hi> and took them there; the Inhabitants of that great City who had no more hopes of relief, having delivered them up, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon for their Rebellion, which was granted them, in that conſideration. The reſt of <hi>Navarre</hi> was recovered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with as great facility as they had loſt it, and their Conqueſt remained ſo ſure, that no attempt was made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to drive them out of it.</p>
            <p>There is ſo little betwixt an indirect War, and direct, that <hi>Chievres</hi> foreſaw that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> would ſoon paſs from the one to the other, if they were not prevented by ſomething of
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:53255:338"/> greater conſequence than all that had been till then Negotiated for making them friends: and as on the one hand he ſaw the moſt Chriſtian King reſolved to cauſe the Treaty of <hi>Noyon</hi> to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its full extent, and on the other, he hoped to diſpoſe the Emperor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his part of it, becauſe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that the Empire had procured him over his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; ſo he uſed all his Policy to take off the <hi>French</hi> from declaring War directly, by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, that if they came to that, they would not only have all the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of two thirds of <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> againſt them. The Union of ſo many Powers, though of different Inclinations and Intereſts could not be croſſed, but by the changes which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> an <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Monk had ſome four years before introduced into Religion; and theſe changes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo great, that they could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied but by a General Diet. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, by the Laws of <hi>Germany,</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to call one immediately after his Coronation; and the City of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> had for many ages had that preference, that for the firſt time it ſhould be held there. Nevertheleſs in the Juncture of affairs at that time it could not be, ſeeing
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:53255:338"/> the Plague was in that Imperial City. There behoved then another to be choſen which was ſpacious enough for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating the Princes and Deputies of the Empire; and the ſame Laws which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> mentioning none other that might ſupply its defect, <hi>Chievres</hi> told the Emperor, that by Law the choice was his, &amp; that by conſequence it was in his power to name the place of Aſſembly. Beſides, he repreſented to his Majeſty that he ought to pitch upon a City near the Low Countries; for if he were but in the leaſt diſtant from thence, if the <hi>French</hi> began the War again during his abſence, they would make great Conqueſts there before he could return to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Upon that ground <hi>Chievres</hi> added, that no City was more commodious than that of <hi>Wormes,</hi> which was wholly Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, that is to ſay, that held of no Prince neither Secular nor Eccleſiaſtical: which was ſituated in a plentiful Countrey; and which moreover was ſo near the Low Countries, that no accident could happen but that his Majeſty would have notice timely enough to remedy it.</p>
            <p>The Emperor, according to his cuſtom, complied with that advice, and the Diet of the Empire was called at <hi>Wormes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1521. <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi>
               <pb n="652" facs="tcp:53255:339"/> attended the Emperor thither, and there loſt his life, after he had loſt that which was deareſt to him in the world. It hath been obſerved before, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew whom he loved moſt, was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son of his Elder Brother, to whom he had given his Name, and who for his ſake had been made Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> Cardinal and Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> He had been bred with the Emperor; and the Sympathie of his humor with that of his Majeſties, had contributed to his promotion, almoſt as much as the merit of his Unkle. He was not as yet full three and twenty years of age, and nevertheleſs he was already of all his Maſters Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. It was not doubted, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other he would have held the place of <hi>Chievres;</hi> and that, according to the Memoires of the houſe of <hi>Croy,</hi> was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe or the occaſion of his death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not endure that theſe two <hi>Flemings</hi> ſhould have a greater ſhare in the Friendſhip of the Emperor, than all the reſt of the Courtiers together; and the former of thoſe two people who had taken no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at all, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, during the whole courſe of his life fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his own Whimſey, and changed his inclinations at every turn, took it ill
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:53255:339"/> that <hi>Charles</hi> his Grandſon ſhould follow the Counſels of the Wiſeſt of men which had been ſo uſeful unto him; and that from his Infancy he had loved amongſt his Subjects, the young Lords of his own age, whom he eſteemed the moſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The other people imputed to <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> and his Nephew, the Civil Wars of <hi>Spain</hi> which we have mentioned. They were perſwaded that they had divided betwixt themſelves, or given to their Creatures the Treaſures of Cardinal <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> and the Revenues of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of <hi>Caſtille</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> during the ſpace of four years: they alſo ſuppoſed, that they had ſold all the Offices and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices of theſe Monarchies: and in that particular, their prejudice was ſo much the more ridiculous, that it could neither ſpecifie the Fleets that had tranſported ſuch prodigious ſums out of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the places where they had been kept, nor yet the purchaces that had been made with them: Nevertheleſs ſo improbable a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and ſo eaſie to be refuted, was received without examination or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. It was generally ſpread abroad; and made ſo deep an impreſſion on mens minds, that they were not undeceived in it, till upon the death of the two perſons whom they had accuſed of that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:53255:340"/> robbing of the publick, it was found that they were no richer at their death, than they were when <hi>Charles</hi> became King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But the falſe opinions that are entertained of Favorites, are no leſs prejudicial to them, than true ones, when they are inſinuated through an exceſs of Credulity; and when they who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to undeceive the people, think it their intereſt to let them continue in their errour. The enemies of <hi>Chievres,</hi> and of the Cardinal <hi>de Croy,</hi> who expected to be enriched by their ſpoils, were ſo far from taking the pains to undeceive the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in their behalf, that they encreaſed the averſion which they had to them; until both of them being gone out of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; by conſequence, having no cauſe to ſuſpect that the Poiſon which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, came from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they began with the Cardinal, and gave him a Doſe that carried him off within a few days after the Emperour came to <hi>Wormes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> being thereby obliged contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the courſe of Nature to ſhut his eyes, from whom he expected that laſt duty, was the more afflicted at it, that he had a ſecret preſentment that they would uſe him in the ſame manner as they had treated the Cardinal whom he lookt upon
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:53255:340"/> as his Son. He prepared to follow him, and ordered both his Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs. He made his Wife the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutrix of his laſt Will and Teſtament, and ſhe acquitted her ſelf of it afterward with all imaginable care. Then he thought it his duty to employ the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of his life in Action; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving none to be more advantageous to the Catholick Religion, than the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Luther,</hi> who was engaged in his Errours, out of ſpight to ſee the <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Monks fruſtrated of the profit that was to be made by the preaching up of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, he propoſed to himſelf to finiſh his Courſe by that. He encouraged the Pope's Nuncio, to repreſent to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in full Diet, that the greateſt evil wherewith <hi>Germany</hi> was then afflicted, was Hereſie; &amp; that by conſequence before all things, a ſtop ſhould be put to that: that the Emperour had the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemies in the world to fight with, who were the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt them, he had ſo much need of all his forces, that if they were in the leaſt divided, he muſt infallibly ſuccumb: That nevertheleſs <hi>Luther</hi> by his new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was about to divide them; and ſow the ſeeds of a Civil War amongſt the different parts of the <hi>German</hi> body,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:53255:341"/> which the Infidels would not fail to make their advantage of. That the Holy See declared againſt that Hereſiarch; and offered to prove that he was Scandalous, a diſturber of publick peace, diſobedient to God and his Superiours, a Blaſphemer, impious wretch, and a Calumniator: That the Paſtoral charity of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, obliged him to hunt the Wolf, hid under the Sheeps skin, out of the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and other <hi>German</hi> Princes aſſiſted not his Holineſs in ſo laudable a deſign, he before-hand proteſted that they would be guilty before the Tribunal of God of all the evils that might happen.</p>
            <p>But there are no inconveniences that ought more ſpeedily to be remedied than thoſe which threaten a great State with an imminent Revolution, becauſe their operation is quicker, and their effects of greater extent. It was already four years ſince <hi>Luther</hi> began to Preach againſt the Catholick Church; and his Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in the year 1517. ſerved only to make ſport for the curious, whilſt they exaggerated the venality of Indulgences, had in the following years perſwaded a vaſt number of people, when they paſſed from the abuſe of the ſame Indulgences, to the power of the Church in granting
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:53255:341"/> them, and when they endeavoured to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all the foundation of that power. The great men had liſtned to that new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as greedily, as the inferiour people; and God who looked upon it as a ſcourge wherewith he intended to puniſh <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> had ſuffered two Princes, whereof the one was the moſt Powerful, and the other the moſt Valiant Prince of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to be convinced of the truth of it. The moſt Powerful was <hi>Frederick</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the moſt Valiant <hi>Philip</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> Both had ſo great credit in the Diet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> that they hindered any deliberation to be made about the Anſwer that was to be given to the Nuncio; and they made ſuch ſtrong parties the days following, that no poſitive Anſwer was given him. To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Deputies from that, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had raiſed an imaginary Monſter to fight with; and that the Nuncio had only made a ſpeech to ſhew his Eloquence in the moſt Auguſt Auditory of <hi>Europe;</hi> and to deſerve a Cardinals hat: That <hi>Luther,</hi> indeed, ſtruck at the abuſes that were crept into the Church, but that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medled with the Faith, nor the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Diſcipline: That it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee the Pope his enemy, ſeeing he
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:53255:342"/> diſputed his power; and the Miniſters of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> riſe up againſt him, ſince he had diſappointed them of two thirds of the profit which they propoſed to make by the publication of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: that it concerned <hi>Germany</hi> to let him preach after his own way, ſo long as he ſpake of nothing but of exempting it from the pillage of the <hi>Italians;</hi> and that it would always be in a condition of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſilence on him, if he went farther, and medled with points of Faith.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio being diſcouraged at the bad ſucceſs of his firſt attempt; and not knowing what part to act in the Diet, where he found by experience that the greateſt part of the deputies were not for him, applied himſelf to <hi>Chievres,</hi> and asked his advice. <hi>Chievres</hi> made him anſwer, that in all appearance, that which had hindered the effect of his harangue, was, that he thought it enough to diſcourſe; and that there behoved ſomething more than words to move the <hi>Germans:</hi> That that Nation was too diffident to believe him upon his word, and too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt in favours of <hi>Luther</hi> to condemn him upon the bare depoſition of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: That in ſpeaking to them, he ought to have convincing proofs in his hands, and that then they would hear with more
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:53255:342"/> Attention, and judge with greater Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Nuncio to whom <hi>Chievres</hi> had ſuggeſted a thought which had not till then come into his mind, replied that it would not be difficult to put in execution what he had propoſed, and that <hi>Luther</hi> had juſt publiſhed a book called <hi>The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Babylon,</hi> wherein he had declared himſelf openly againſt the Catholick Church, reſumed all his antient errours, and added a great many new: That the divines whom the Pope had given him to attend on him in his Nunciature, had examined the book; and that they had extracted out of it, forty ſuch terrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that to hear them was ſufficient to make them be abhorred: That he ſhould cauſe them to be Tranſcribed in the very terms they were expreſt in, and the pages where they were to be found quoted: That he ſhould read them to the Diet; and preſs them to employ their authority for ſtopping the impudence of a Monk, which they had already ſuffered but too long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chievres</hi> approved the Expedient, and the Legat put it in practice in the next Aſſembly of the Diet. He ſaid, that it ſeemed to him, that the Diet had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected enough upon what he had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, upon occaſion of <hi>Luther;</hi>
               <pb n="660" facs="tcp:53255:343"/> and drawing out of his pocket the forty Propoſitions we mentioned, he read them with an audible voice, and without either exaggeration or commentary. The effect proved to be as <hi>Chievres</hi> had foreſeen, and immediately it appeared by the murmur which it raiſed amongſt the Electors, Princes and Deputies of the Empire: There were already a great many <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> amongſt them, but there were but a few that were ſo upon ſufficient informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All of them for moſt part believed that <hi>Luther</hi> had neither preached nor writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but againſt the abuſes which time and humane inconſtancy had brought into the Catholick Church; and thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his doctrine more narrowly, thought that he had only undertaken to re-eſtabliſh the antient diſcipline in the important points wherein there was ſome relaxation. But when they underſtood that he had paſſed from the uſe of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to the very ſource of them, and that he queſtioned the power of the Holy See in granting them, and the Article of Purgatory which ſerved for their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: That he had denied Free-will, the merit of good Works, the perfection of the ſtate of Virginity, and of a Single Life, five of the ſeven Sacraments, and the Tranſubſtantiation in the Euchariſt;
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:53255:343"/> their amazement was ſoon followed with indignation that they had been deceived, and the order that they were about to make for apprehending <hi>Luther,</hi> had been the ſign of it, if the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who foreſaw the blow had not prevented it, by riſing and demanding to be heard.</p>
            <p>It could not be denied to a perſon of his degree, and he ſpake, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Legat. He maintained in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal terms, that the propoſitions which the Diet had heard, were none of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s; and that it came never into the thoughts of that Doctor, either to teach, or write them: That the Legat himſelf, or ſome others devoted as he was, to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had invented them: That there was no other cauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred and revenge which his eloquent Sermons wrought in them, but the ſhameful and publick commerce of Indulgences, againſt which, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed: That the Book of the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> out of which ſo many bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies were ſaid to be taken, was none of <hi>Luther</hi>'s; or if it was, he queſtioned whether any of the propoſitions that had offended the ears of the Aſſembly, were found in it.</p>
            <p>The Legat, who with his own eyes, had read the Propoſitions in the book of
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:53255:344"/> the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> and knew that <hi>Luther</hi> had not only written it, but alſo Corrected the Proofs from the Preſs, proteſted that there was nothing truer than what he had aſſerted, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he might be admitted to prove it Judicially. The Elector replyed that he could not; and the diſpute grew ſo hot, that the Emperor was forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his Authority to put a ſtop to it, and impoſe ſilence, both upon the Elector and the Nuncio, by offering to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>He ſaid in a few words, that the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the affair in hand, required that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſhould appear perſonally in the Diet, out of his own mouth to give an account of what he had done, becauſe if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he had written the book of the <hi>Captivity of Babylon,</hi> the debate betwixt the Elector and the Nuncio would be at an end; and if he diſowned it, then the Nuncio might be allowed to make it out. The opinion of his Imperial Majeſty was ſo univerſally followed, that the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> with all his credit could not hinder but that <hi>Luther</hi> was ſent for: but he ſoon ſtarted ſtrange difficulties about the Security that ſhould be given him. The Emperor offered a ſafe-conduct, but the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were not ſatisfied with that. The inſtances of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi>
               <pb n="663" facs="tcp:53255:344"/> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were burnt notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the like aſſurance given, encreaſed their diſtruſt, when they called to mind, that both of them had repaired to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> upon the Security of a ſafe-conduct in good form, from the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmund;</hi> and yet for all that had been puniſhed with the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of puniſhments. They knew beſides, that the Council had not wanted Divines, who to excuſe what it had done, had then, and ſince, maintained that Faith was not to be kept to Hereticks; and that there were ſtill Catholick Schools which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taught, That the attempts of <hi>Luther,</hi> againſt Religion, and the Holy See, being of publick Notoriety, it was not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuffer them; and that one might with a ſafe Conſcience diſpenſe with the breach of promiſe that might be given him, ſince he himſelf had neither kept his word to God nor man. From thence they concluded, that it would be the way to undo <hi>Luther,</hi> to conſent that he ſhould come into a place where his enemies would be the ſtronger, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſhould be Petitioned to be ſatisfied that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould anſwer in writing to the Accuſations of the Nuncio: but the Catholick Deputies could not endure that any more ſhould be required than a
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:53255:345"/> ſafe-conduct for a ſimple Monk ſuch as <hi>Luther.</hi> They maintained that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Emperor, to ſuſpect him of unfaithfulneſs on that occaſion; and that they who ſought extraordinary ſecurity for <hi>Luther,</hi> did him incomparably more hurt than good, becauſe they turned againſt him, the prejudice of all diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted perſons, by giving them occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to believe that they muſt needs think him not altogether innocent, ſeeing they were ſo fearful that the Law of Nations might be violated in reſpect of him in the ſecureſt place of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Catholick Deputies had infallibly carried it from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Luther</hi>'s friends, if the Votes of theſe had not been fortified when it was leaſt thought on by the Deputies of the Imperial Cities. One part of them had openly declared for <hi>Luther,</hi> and the other part had given ſecret inſtructions to their Deputies to favour him underhand as much as they could. They failed not to do it upon occaſion of the ſafe conduct, and repreſented ſo ſtrongly that it was not enough now, to have one expeded in the antient form, ſince the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had diſcovered a way how it might be ſafely violated, that the Emperor was forced to conſent that
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:53255:345"/> a new one might be found out that ſhould content the friends of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Deputies of the Imperial Towns, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abſolutely diſpleaſing the reſt of the Diet. <hi>Chievres</hi> had the Commiſſion to do it, and acquitted himſelf in it with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal approbation, having uſed ſuch ſtrains of wit, as cannot be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, than by the great blazes of a light when it is upon the point of going out.</p>
            <p>He had in the laſt Aſſemblies of the Diet wherein <hi>Luther</hi> was mentioned, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe who were moſt favourable unto him; and ſeeing he made no doubt but that they would defend him in the Diet, at the peril of their lives, in caſe they offered to Arreſt him, he thought there would be no danger in it to ſuffer them to be his Security; ſeeing as they were then diſpoſed they would not fail to perform that duty, though it were not deſired they ſhould. He thereupon ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> whilſt the Emperors ableſt Agents ſounded ſome of the Princes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> whether they were in the humour to joyn their Guarranty with that of his Majeſty, to aſſure <hi>Luther</hi> that he might come to the Diet, and return back again with all ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe Princes, who expected not that
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:53255:346"/> ſuch a thing ſhould be demanded of them, granted it with the more joy, that it eaſed them of a great trouble: For ſo ſoon as they heard it moved, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould be obliged to appear, they made no doubt but that the Diet would agree to it; and ſeeing they foreſaw that the Emperour, to engage the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in his intereſts againſt <hi>France,</hi> would Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto them <hi>Luther,</hi> they ſuppoſed that his Majeſty would ſeize the perſon of that Monk, whether he retracted or perſiſted in his new Doctrines; and ſend him into <hi>Italy</hi> under a ſure Guard, where he would be tried as a broacher of Hereſies. They had reſolved by all means, to withſtand that pretended violence with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sequinguen</hi> a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran Gentleman, who commanded a pretty conſiderable number of Soldiers in the neighbourhood of <hi>Wormes,</hi> and had promiſed to ſtand by them if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The only inconvenience which ſeemed to them inevitable, was the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial procedures, whereby the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would proſecute them with all vigour, ſo ſoon as they ſhould have ſaved <hi>Luther.</hi> The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would put their Territories under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict, and the Emperor puniſh them with the Outlawry of the Empire. They
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:53255:346"/> were not very apprehenſive of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Holy See; becauſe there was no Army in readineſs to Second them; but they feared ſo much the more to be proſcribed by their Secular Magiſtrate, who was the Emperor, as that they knew that the Laws of <hi>Germany</hi> authoriſed the puniſhing of the attempt, which they had a deſign to commit. They could not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt thoſe Laws, but by the Guarranty that was demanded; becauſe if they granted it, and maintained the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Luther,</hi> though by force of Arms, they would always be excuſed for having kept, even contrary to the Emperors will, a promiſe which they made not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his conſent, but more, at his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation; and if theſe two Pretexts were wanting, they could not avoid the Confiſcation of their Lands, what other colour ſoever they might take for having reſcued <hi>Luther</hi> from his Imperial Majeſty.</p>
            <p>They made anſwer then to <hi>Chievres,</hi> that the Emperor did them too great an honour, to admit of them to joyn with him in promiſe, and that they conſented to it with all their hearts. But <hi>Chievres</hi> not reſting there, asked them, if they thought after that, that <hi>Luther</hi> would make any more difficulty to come; and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> bolder than the
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:53255:347"/> reſt, becauſe he had him in his Country, replied, that if he came not, he would fetch him himſelf, rather than that his Imperial Majeſty ſhould want the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing and hearing him, ſeeing he ſeemed to deſire it. <hi>Chievres</hi> having in this manner negotiated with the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> conferred with the Catholick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties; and repreſented to them, that the Nuncio and Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had brought the buſineſs of <hi>Luther</hi> to that paſs, that it was abſolutely neceſſary the Monk ſhould come himſelf, and give the Diet an account of his Doctrine: That it ſignified nothing in what manner the ſafe-conduct were framed to be ſent unto him, ſeeing it was the Emperors inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be punctual to him in his word, and could not violate it without kindling a Civil War in <hi>Germany;</hi> but he judged it convenient that there ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the ſafe-conduct, a condition which might be ſufficient to ſecure the Catholick Religion from all prejudice: That the condition was to ſtipulate that <hi>Luther,</hi> neither upon his way from <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> to <hi>Wormes,</hi> nor during his ſtay there, ſhould not preach, write, or ſpeak, in any manner, of the opinions which he had, contrary to the Sentiments of the Antient Church. The Catholick Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:53255:347"/> approved the ſafe-conduct with the qualification propoſed, and <hi>Chievres</hi> cauſed it immediately to be expeded: But humane frailty never moves thoſe who ſeriouſly reflect upon it to greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, than when they conſider that the greateſt men are ſo ſubject to failing, that though they be ſo happy as not to commit faults in projecting difficult affairs, yet they are not ſo in the execution of them. Prudence could do no more, as to the manner how <hi>Chievres</hi> had adjuſted the ſafe-conduct; and it is acknowledged that no inconvenience would have enſued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, if it had been entruſted to faithful hands: But it was <hi>Chievres</hi> his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to make a bad choice of him who was employed to carry it to <hi>Luther.</hi> The Emperor had brought up a young <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Gentleman called <hi>John Sturmie,</hi> who promiſed much. There were none at the Court of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> that applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much to ſtudy as he, and yet none had leſs than he contracted the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Students: it had rendered him neither more ſullen, nor leſs gay, more vain, nor leſs charming in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He ſucceeded the beſt in all ſorts of Exerciſe, and the politeneſs of his manners equalled that of his mind. <hi>Chievres,</hi> who eſteemed him according to the merit that
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:53255:348"/> he obſerved in him, propoſed him often to the Emperor for little Negotiations, till more maturity of age might make him capable of greater. He procured him the Commiſſion of bringing <hi>Luther</hi> from <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> and conducting him to <hi>Wormes,</hi> of defraying his charges upon the road, and of obſerving him ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might not be able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the condition of the ſafe-conduct, though he might have a mind to do it: But <hi>Chievres</hi> knew not that <hi>Sturmie</hi> was the unſitteſt perſon of the Emperor's Court for the employment he deſigned him for, and that he was in Judgment and Inclination a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> though he had till then diſſembled his change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Emperor's and Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi>'s Letters to <hi>Luther</hi> were no ſooner expeded, but <hi>Sturmie</hi> parted from <hi>Wormes</hi> with a very Magnificent Train, having for that end added mony of his own to that which was given him for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Commiſſion. <hi>Luther,</hi> who would not have budged, if they had ſent one leſs affectionate to conduct him, or who at leaſt would not have undertaken the journey, but with fear and trembling, and as a Criminal led to execution; joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet out upon the word of <hi>Sturmie,</hi> and travelled as in Triumph; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:53255:348"/> having intimated to him privately that a more favourable occaſion could not be offered of ſpreading his doctrine in a trice all over <hi>Germany,</hi> by publiſhing it himſelf, with that extraordinary elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which was natural to him in the moſt Auguſt Theatre in <hi>Europe:</hi> That he had ſo little cauſe of fear to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there, that his enemies dreaded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to ſee him there: That they had uſed all manner of artifices to divert the Emperor from ſending for him; but that at length the Solicitations of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Emperor had to that Prince, had carried it over the Officers of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was ſuch as it ought to be, and that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould not boggle at the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein inſerted: That it was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, granted to the importunity of the Papiſts, but that it bound no more than as he thought convenient; and that he aſſured him before hand, that he himſelf would not be called to an account for not having obſerved him.</p>
            <p>In this confidence <hi>Luther</hi> parted from <hi>Wittemberg</hi> with <hi>Sturmie,</hi> and took along with him three of the moſt famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of that City, whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his party. He boldly travelled
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:53255:349"/> over the greateſt part of <hi>Germany;</hi> and in all places found the road full of curious people who came out to ſee a Monk, who was ſo variouſly talked of in the world, and with ſo much heat. The croud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of perſons of quality as well as of thoſe of inferiour rank; and both ſorts took notice that he loved Muſick and good Cheer. He never eat in publick without one of the two, and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without both together. After dinner ſometimes he took his Lute, on which he plaid exquiſitely well: He ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to Preach in the Towns where he made any ſtay; and by one Sermon he turned the Town of <hi>Auſdors</hi> wholly <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran.</hi> His Preaching in <hi>Erford</hi> was a continued Satyr againſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> upon occaſion of Merit and the ſatisfaction of Good Works; and that it might produce the greater effect, it was no ſooner preached, but that with <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>'s conſent it was Printed, which was a manifeſt contravention of the Orders he had received.</p>
            <p>Next day after <hi>Luther</hi> arrived at <hi>Wormes</hi> he had Audience of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who received him well: but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſent him word afterwards, that he ſhould preciſely Anſwer the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories that were to be put to him in full
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:53255:349"/> Diet, and not to enlarge, as his uſual way was, in ſuperfluous diſcourſes. <hi>Luther</hi> obeyed that order no more than he had complied with the condition of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct. He came into the Diet the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1521, and the Adverſary that was to encounter him was <hi>Ekius</hi> Proviſor of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Treves. Ekius</hi> told him, that he was ſent for, for two things; the one to know from his own mouth, if he had written, and if he owned for his, the Books that were Printed in his name; and the other if he was ready to maintain all the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contained in them, and if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to retract any of them. The Demand ſeemed too wide to one of the three Divines whom <hi>Luther</hi> had brought with him from <hi>Wormes,</hi> and he ſaid, that the Books out of which the Propoſitions were taken ought to be ſpecified, to the end that <hi>Luther</hi> might make a more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical Anſwer. <hi>Ekius</hi> thought the Objection reaſonable; and ſeeing he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that it would be made to him, he took out of his Pocket a Catalogue of <hi>Luther</hi>'s works, with the date of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the name of the Towns and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He read it diſtinctly and with a loud voice; and then turning to <hi>Luther,</hi> preſſed him to explain himſelf without ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <pb n="674" facs="tcp:53255:350"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> then made Anſwer, that he could not but own for his, all the books that had been reckoned up to him. That the truth was, he had compoſed them: that he would never deny it; and that that was all that he had to ſay to the firſt interrogatory of <hi>Ekius:</hi> but that, as to the ſecond, which concerned the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what he had written, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured all his Auditors to conſider, that his raſhneſs would be inſupportable, if he complied with it upon the ſpot, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out convenient reflection upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which he had handled, ſeeing the Salvation of Souls, and the Power of the Word of God was concerned. From thence he concluded, that he ought to be allowed time to Reviſe, what had dropt from his Pen during the ſpace of four years; and that then he promiſed to anſwer with all neceſſary ſincerity, for the diſcharge of his own Conſcience, and giving the glory which belonged to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi>'s anſwer perplexed the Diet; and the general murmur that followed upon it, was a proof of the ſame. The Emperor was but too ſenſible of it when the matter was put to the Vote; and he found the Voices ſo divided, that he had much a do to bring them to his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which nevertheleſs at length car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:53255:350"/> it. The zealous Catholicks would have had <hi>Luther</hi> explain himſelf at the very inſtant, becauſe they underſtood that he ſhould be condemned and puniſhed immediately after he had ſpokn. The <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> on the contrary, being perſwaded that the beſt of <hi>Luther</hi>'s talents was his Eloquence, were for having him diſplay it to the Diet in its full extent; and would by conſequence have his anſwer delayed, until the concluſion of the Diet; to the end he might have time to prepare his harangue, and to render it more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious. The Emperor's opinion held a mean betwixt the two that we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and contained all that was good in either of them, without running to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, in the point which was thought dangerous. His Majeſty thought that <hi>Luther</hi> might have ground to complain that he was too rigorouſly dealt with, if he were forced to explain himſelf inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concerning ſo many novelties of which he was accuſed; but it ſeemed to him alſo, that a day might ſuffice him to come to a final reſolution about matters which he could not but many times have thought on, and that if a longer time were granted him, he would but abuſe it.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was ſo ſucceſsful as to
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:53255:351"/> bring both parties to this; and then commanded <hi>Ekius</hi> to tell <hi>Luther</hi> that the Diet knew very well, that he was not come without being informed of the ground for which he was ſent for, nor without having taken his meaſures, as to what he was to Anſwer, and that ſo his Majeſty did him no injuſtice, though he granted him not the time which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: That nevertheleſs, to take from him even the Pretexts of complaining, and to uſe him with all clemency, the Emperor allowed him four and twenty hours for the longeſt delay: That he ſhould return then next day at the ſame hour; and that he ſhould have Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, provided he brought with him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in writing, and that he did only ſpeak. <hi>Luther</hi> obeyed, and next day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Diet at the time prefixed. He ſpake two full hours, and made an harangue, which was the abridgement of his book of the <hi>Captivity of Babylon. Ekius</hi> being impatient to hear him out, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he ſpake nothing of retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, interrupted him, and asked whether or no he perſiſted in maintaining the Propoſitions which he had owned for his own. <hi>Luther</hi> anſwered that he could not, nor would not revoke any thing of what he had written, until he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:53255:351"/> of his errour, by evident Texts of Scripture, and invincible Arguments: That theſe were the only Weapons that he pretended ſhould be uſed againſt him, ſeeing he had no other to attack his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries with. That he ſubmitted not to the Authority of Councils and Popes, becauſe he had obſerved an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of caſes, wherein both had been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; and that it was no more in his power to retract what he had written, than not to believe it.</p>
            <p>It is probable that the blunder of <hi>Ekius</hi> diſcompoſed the affair, which till then <hi>Chievres</hi> had ſucceſsfully carried on; and that if that Divine had not interrupted <hi>Luther</hi> in the beginning of his ſpeech, and before the Orator had obſerved in the countenance of his hearers the effect that it wrought upon them; <hi>Luther</hi> being doubtful of the ſucceſs, and in the cool that men are commonly in upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, would not at all have declared, or at leaſt not ſo plainly in Juſtification of his Writings. But after that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued diſcourſe of two hours long, had exceedingly warmed him, and that he obſerved that what he ſaid pleaſed one half of the Aſſembly; his boldneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and drew from him what never would have come out of his mouth upon
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:53255:352"/> any other occaſion. That which raiſed higheſt indignation in the Catholicks was, that <hi>Luther</hi> added to what we have related, theſe words, which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all Oaths that are taken, <hi>So help me God, Amen;</hi> and that the Deputies of the Diet broke up upon it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without going to a Vote.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther,</hi> as he went out, received ſuch Applauſes from thoſe who favoured him, as he had not expected: many to do him honour waited upon him to his Lodgings, and <hi>Chievres</hi> who viſited him the day following, laboured in vain to draw a Recantation from him. He excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under pretext of the Oath which he had taken; but the true cauſe of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy was, that he thought himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in honour to maintain as long as he lived, what once he had declared in full Diet. What we have now related hapned about the end of <hi>April,</hi> 1521, and ſome days after <hi>Chievres</hi> was poiſoned; or the poiſon that was long before given him began to work, if the relations of his death be more certain in the latter part of this alternative than in the former. He ſupported his evil with extraordinary patience: and died the Eighteenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1521. in the City of <hi>Wormes,</hi> at the age of 63 years. The Duke of <hi>Aſcot</hi>
               <pb n="679" facs="tcp:53255:352"/> his Nephew and Heir ſucceeded him in his Places, and in the Emperors favour, who by that evidenced more effectually than by the Tears which he ſhed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that he had for his loſs. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was made of <hi>Chievres</hi> was, that he infinitely ſurpaſſed all the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of great Princes that went before him; and that if he had lived longer, the War that was not as yet directly broken out betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> would have been by his care prevented, and would not have occaſioned either the Conqueſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the Battel of <hi>Pavia.</hi>
